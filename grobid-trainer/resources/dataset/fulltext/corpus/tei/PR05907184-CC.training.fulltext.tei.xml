			<p>The presence of a pseudogap in the normal state of<lb/> underdoped high temperature superconductors is by now<lb/> widely accepted. <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref> The strongest evidence for the pseu-<lb/>dogap state comes from recent measurements of an-<lb/>gle resolved photoemission spectra <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref> as well as vac-<lb/>uum tunneling <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. However, these techniques both de-<lb/>mand extremely high surface quality and have therefore<lb/> mainly been restricted to Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ (Bi221) and<lb/> YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (Y123) materials, both with two CuO 2<lb/> layers per unit cell. Techniques that probe deeper into<lb/> the sample such as dc transport <ref type="biblio">[4-6]</ref>, optical conduc-<lb/>tivity <ref type="biblio">[7-9]</ref> and NMR <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref> were not only the earliest to<lb/> show evidence of the pseudogap but have been extended<lb/> to a much larger variety of materials, including several<lb/> materials with one CuO 2 . <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref> In all cases evidence for a<lb/> pseudogap has been reported.<lb/></p>

			<p>The pseudogap in LSCO as seen by NMR and neu-<lb/>tron scattering <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref> is rather weak and has led to the<lb/> suggestion that the existence of the pseudogap in the<lb/> spin excitation spectrum is only possible in bilayer com-<lb/>pounds such as Y123 and YBa 2 Cu 4 O 4 (Y124). In par-<lb/>ticular, Millis and Monien attribute the pseudogap (or<lb/> the spin gap) to strong antiferromagnetic correlations be-<lb/>tween the planes in the bilayer, which are responsible for<lb/> a quantum order-disorder transition. <ref type="biblio">[10]<lb/></ref> Apart<lb/> from<lb/> having<lb/> only one CuO 2 layer La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) is also a<lb/> good model system for the study of doping dependences<lb/> since it can be doped by the addition of strontium over<lb/> a wide range: from the underdoped, where T c increases<lb/> with Sr content, to the optimally doped where T c reaches<lb/> its maximum value of ≈ 40 K at x = 0.17, and to the<lb/> overdoped region where T c → 0 at x = 0.34. <ref type="biblio">[6]<lb/></ref> The characteristic signatures of the pseudogap state<lb/> in the dc resistivity <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref> are seen clearly in LSCO <ref type="biblio">[6,12]</ref>.<lb/> These are the striking deviations below a temperature T *<lb/> from the high temperature linear resistivity, resulting in<lb/> a clear break in slope at T * . It was found by B. Batlogg<lb/> et al. <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref> that in LSCO T * decreases from 800 K to ap-<lb/>proximately 300 K as the doping level is increased from<lb/> the strongly underdoped to just over the optimal doping<lb/> level. Similar behavior at T = T * has been observed in<lb/> the Hall effect coefficient and the magnetic susceptibility.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[13,14]<lb/></ref> The pseudogap can also be observed if the conductiv-<lb/>ity is measured in the frequency domain, σ(ω), where it<lb/> shows up as a striking depression of the frequency depen-<lb/>dent scattering rate at low frequency. It is found that<lb/> below a frequency Ω p ≈ 600 cm −1 , the scattering rate<lb/> drops below its high temperature, high frequency, linear<lb/> behavior. This effect has been clearly identified in the<lb/> bilayer materials. <ref type="biblio">[7-9]</ref> One of the aims of this paper is<lb/> to see if this behavior can also be observed in LSCO. A<lb/> pseudogap state can be defined in terms of this suppres-<lb/>sion of scattering: the material is in the pseudogap state<lb/> when the scattering rate falls below the high frequency<lb/> straight-line extrapolation. In the low frequency limit<lb/> the scattering rate is proportional to the dc resistivity.<lb/> Due to this, the 1/τ (ω,T) suppression should be com-<lb/>pared to the suppression of ρ DC (T) <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref> at temperatures<lb/> below the linear T dependence region. The IR measure-<lb/>ment gives us the possibility to see both the frequency<lb/> and the temperature dependence of this feature.<lb/></p>

			<p>axis IR conductivity in the form of a gap-like region of<lb/> depressed conductivity at low frequency. It has been re-<lb/>ported in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−x (Y123) and YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 (Y124)<lb/> materials <ref type="biblio">[7,15]</ref> as well as in LSCO <ref type="biblio">[16,17]</ref>. In slightly<lb/> underdoped LSCO the pseudogap state in the c-axis di-<lb/>rection is not as well defined as it is in the two plane<lb/> materials. <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref> However, as the doping is reduced further,<lb/> the c-axis pseudogap state features below 0.1 eV become<lb/> clearer. <ref type="biblio">[17]<lb/></ref> Previous work on the in-plane σ(ω) of the single layer<lb/> lanthanum strontium cuprate includes work on the oxy-<lb/>gen doped La 2 CuO 4−δ <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>, thin films of LSCO <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref> as<lb/> well as work done on LSCO single crystal at room tem-<lb/>perature <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>. To our knowledge, a study of the tem-<lb/>perature and doping dependence has not been done. We<lb/> fill this gap here by performing optical measurements on<lb/> high-quality LSCO single crystals at temperatures rang-<lb/>ing from 10 K to 300 K at two different doping levels,<lb/> both slightly underdoped. Also the optical properties of<lb/> both the ab-plane and c-axis of La 1.87 Sr 0.13 CuO 4 were<lb/> measured on the same crystal.<lb/></p>

			<p>To better display the effect of increased coherence on<lb/> σ(ω) ab resulting from the formation of the pseudogap<lb/> state we use the memory function, or extended Drude<lb/> analysis. In this treatment the complex optical conduc-<lb/>tivity is modeled by a Drude spectrum with a frequency-<lb/></p>

			<p>dependent scattering rate and an effective electron mass.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[20,21]</ref> While the optical conductivity tends to emphasize<lb/> free particle behavior, a study of the frequency depen-<lb/>dence of the effective scattering rate puts more weight<lb/> on displaying the interactions of the free particles with<lb/> the elementary excitations of the system. <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref> The tem-<lb/>perature evolution of the frequency dependent scattering<lb/> rate and effective mass spectra are of particular interest<lb/> and are defined as follows:<lb/></p>

The critical temperature was determined by<lb/> both SQUID magnetization and resistivity measurements<lb/> and was found to be 36 K for the nominal concentration<lb/> of Sr x = 0.14 and 32 K for x = 0.13. Since the highest<lb/> T c in the LSCO system has been found to be 40 K for<lb/> x = 0.17, we conclude that both crystals are underdoped.<lb/></p>

			<p>To get an uncontaminated ab-plane measurement, it is<lb/> important to have the sample surface accurately parallel<lb/> to the ab-plane to avoid any c-axis contribution to the<lb/> optical conductivity. <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref> The miscut angle between the<lb/> polished surface normal and the c-axis was checked by<lb/> a high precision triple axis x-ray diffractometer and was<lb/> determined to be less than 0.8%.<lb/></p>

			<p>All reflectivity measurements were performed with a<lb/> Michelson interferometer using three different detectors<lb/> which cover frequencies ranging from 10 to 10000 cm −1<lb/> (1.25 meV -1.25 eV). The experimental uncertainty in<lb/> the reflectance data does not exceed 1%. The dc resis-<lb/>tivity measurements were carried out using a standard<lb/> 4-probe technique.<lb/></p>

			<p>The result of the resistivity measurement on the same<lb/> La 1.86 Sr 0.14 CuO 4 single crystal used in the optical mea-<lb/>surements is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. It is commonly accepted<lb/> that the DC-resistivity is linear at high temperatures for<lb/> LSCO and that the pseudogap begins to form near the<lb/> temperature where the resistivity drops below this lin-<lb/>ear trend. <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref> At lower temperatures there is a region of<lb/> superlinear temperature dependent resistivity. The T *<lb/> value for our samples with x = 0.13 and x = 0.14 ex-<lb/>tracted from the phase diagram of Batlogg et al., <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref> are<lb/> 650 K and 450 K, respectively. In agreement with this,<lb/> the resistivity shows a superlinear temperature depen-<lb/>dence below room temperature as expected in the pseu-<lb/>dogap region.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> we present the reflectivity data at temper-<lb/>atures above and below T c for the two samples. For<lb/> clarity, only three temperatures are shown: T = 300 K,<lb/> an intermediate temperature above the superconducting<lb/> transition and a low temperature ≈ 10 K in the super-<lb/>conducting state. In the frequency region shown the re-<lb/>flectance is strongly temperature dependent for both ma-<lb/>terials, dropping by approximately 10% as temperature<lb/> is increased from the lowest temperature to T = 300 K.<lb/> The plasma edge is observed at 7800 cm −1 (see insert<lb/> of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The distinct peaks at approximately 135 and<lb/> 365 cm −1 in the LSCO reflectivity spectra correspond<lb/> to the excitation of ab-plane T O phonons and the peak<lb/> at 500 cm −1 corresponds to a LO phonon. <ref type="biblio">[26]</ref> As in<lb/> all other HTSC materials, the ab plane has a coherent<lb/> response with very high reflectance.<lb/></p>

Top panel: the low temperature frequency depen-<lb/>dent scattering rate of La1.87Sr0.13CuO4 below T * * (a) and<lb/> above T * * (b) is calculated using Equation (1)</figure>

			<p>. The onset<lb/> of the suppression in a conductivity corresponds to a dras-<lb/>tic change in the frequency dependence of the scattering rate<lb/> below T * . Above 700 cm −1 the scattering rate is nearly tem-<lb/>perature independent and has a linear frequency dependence<lb/> below T * * . Below 700 cm −1 the scattering rate varies as<lb/> ω 1+δ and shows a strong temperature dependence. Bottom<lb/> panel: The effective mass of La1.87Sr0.13CuO4 below T * * (a)<lb/> and above T * * (b) is calculated using Equation (2). The on-<lb/>set of enhancement of m * (ω)<lb/> me<lb/> corresponds to the onset of the<lb/> suppression of the scattering rate.<lb/></p>

			<p>The complex optical conductivity σ(ω) was obtained<lb/> by Kramers-Kronig analysis of the reflectivity data.<lb/></p>

			<p>Since, in principle, this analysis requires knowledge of<lb/> the reflectance at all frequencies, reflectivity extensions<lb/> must be used at high and low frequencies. The Hagen-<lb/>Rubens formula was used for the low frequency reflectiv-<lb/>ity extrapolation, with parameters taken from the dc re-<lb/>sistivity measurements on the same sample with x = 0.14<lb/> shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and the results of H. Takagi et al. <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref> for<lb/> the sample with x = 0.13. For the high-frequency exten-<lb/>sion for ω &gt; 8000 cm −1 we used the reflectivity results of<lb/> Uchida et al. <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref> At frequencies higher than 40 eV the<lb/> reflectivity was assumed to fall as 1/ω 4 .<lb/></p>

			<p>We calculate the plasma frequency of the supercon-<lb/>ducting charge carriers and the London penetration<lb/> depth using the following formula: <ref type="biblio">[28]<lb/></ref> ǫ 1 = 1 −<lb/> ω 2<lb/> ps<lb/> ω 2 .<lb/></formula>

				<label>(3)<lb/></label>

			<p>The slope of the low-frequency dielectric function,<lb/> ǫ 1 (ω), plotted as a function of w −2 in Fig. <ref type="figure">3a,b</ref> gives<lb/> plasma frequencies of 6100 cm −1 and 5700 cm −1 in the<lb/> superconducting state. The corresponding London pen-<lb/>etration depths are λ L = 1/2πω ps = 250 nm and 280 nm<lb/> for La 1.86 Sr 0.14 CuO 4 and La 1.87 Sr 0.13 CuO 4 , respectively.<lb/> These values are in good agreement with those obtained<lb/> previously by Gao et al. in films <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref> (λ L = 275 ± 5 nm)<lb/> and by muon-spin-relaxation <ref type="biblio">[29]</ref> (λ L = 250 nm).<lb/></p>

			<p>The c-axis reflectance of the x = 0.13 sample is shown<lb/> in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The corresponding conductivity is low and is<lb/> dominated by optical phonons (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In YBCO 123 and 124 the pseudogap in c-axis conduc-<lb/>tivity manifests itself as a depression in conductivity at<lb/> low frequency. <ref type="biblio">[15,7,30]</ref> There is no coherent Drude peak<lb/> and the conductivity is flat and frequency independent.<lb/> In the temperature and doping range where a pseudogap<lb/> is expected a low frequency depression of conductivity is<lb/> seen with an edge in the 300-400 cm −1 region where the<lb/> conductivity rises to the high frequency plateau.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to isolate the electronic features of our LSCO<lb/> c-axis spectrum we magnify the low value region of σ 1c<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). There is no sharp pseudogap edge in the low-<lb/>frequency infrared data for underdoped LSCO as there<lb/> is in the case of Y123. It is possible that such a fea-<lb/>ture could be hidden under the large phonon structure.<lb/> Efforts to subtract the phonons in order to extract the<lb/> background conductivity were found to be extremely sen-<lb/>sitive to the choice of their shape in fitting procedures.<lb/> Nonetheless, the raw data clearly show that there is low<lb/> frequency depression of the c-axis conductivity. Conduc-<lb/>tivity at 450 cm −1 is uniformly suppressed below T=300<lb/> K (Fig. <ref type="figure">5insert</ref>), whereas the conductivity at 600 cm −1 is<lb/> nearly constant at all temperatures. Based on this anal-<lb/>ysis one can conclude that the pseudogap state in the c-<lb/>axis opens up below 300 K and its size is approximately<lb/> equal to 500 cm −1 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Manifestations of the pseudogap in the ab-plane con-<lb/>ductivity exist as a loss of spectral weight between 700<lb/></p>

In the high frequency region, starting at<lb/> about 700 cm −1 , the scattering rate varies linearly with<lb/> frequency while in the low frequency region there is a<lb/> clear suppression of 1/τ (ω,T) below this linear trend.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[31]</ref> The temperature where this suppression first appears<lb/> serves as a definition of T * , the onset temperature of the<lb/> pseudogap state. As the temperature is lowered below T *<lb/> this suppression becomes deeper. We find that for under-<lb/>doped La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 T * ≥ 400 K, an order of magnitude<lb/> higher than the superconducting transition temperature<lb/> T c (32 K). This is significantly different from previous<lb/> results on cuprates where T * more or less coincides with<lb/> T c near optimal doping.<lb/></p>

			<p>The temperature dependence above 700 cm −1 is<lb/> strongly influenced by the level of Sr doping. In the<lb/> underdoped sample the high frequency scattering rate<lb/> is nearly temperature independent up to a certain tem-<lb/>perature (Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>), which we will call T * *<lb/> above which a pronounced temperature dependence of<lb/> 1/τ (ω,T) is seen (Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">9b</ref>). In the x = 0.13<lb/> sample T * * ≈ 200 K while in the x = 0.14 sample<lb/> T * * ≈ 150 K. In the overdoped samples the scattering<lb/> rate above 700 cm −1 increases uniformly with temper-<lb/>ature <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref> at all temperatures suggesting T * * → 0 in<lb/> that limit. This behavior is also seen in other overdoped<lb/> HTSC. <ref type="biblio">[31]<lb/></ref> If one extrapolates the 300 K scattering rates to zero<lb/> frequency one finds that for the x = 0.13 sample the<lb/> scattering rate 1/τ 0 ≈ 2500 cm −1 and for the x = 0.13<lb/> sample this rate is ≈ 1500 cm −1 . These scattering rates<lb/> are much higher than what is seen for the higher T c ma-<lb/>terials reviewed by Puchkov et al. <ref type="biblio">[31]</ref> where at 300 K<lb/> 1/τ 0 ≈ 1000 ± 200 cm −1 for several families and many<lb/> doping levels. This high residual scattering differentiates<lb/> the LSCO material from the other cuprates.<lb/></p>

			<p>If we call the frequency below which the scattering rate<lb/> is suppressed the ab-plane pseudogap ω ab ≈ 700 cm −1<lb/> we find it is clearly bigger than the c-axis pseudogap<lb/> frequency ω c ≈ 500 cm −1<lb/> In addition to the pseudogap depth and temperature<lb/> dependence, several other features of Figures <ref type="figure">8 and 9<lb/></ref> should be mentioned. The position of the pseudogap re-<lb/>mains at 700 cm −1 for all temperatures. There are also<lb/> several peaks positioned at 500 cm −1 in the scattering<lb/> rate which complicate the analysis, particularly in the<lb/> case of the sample with x = 0.14. These peaks have been<lb/> observed by other groups and have been attributed to po-<lb/>laronic effects. <ref type="biblio">[33,34]</ref> Another possible explanation is the<lb/> correlation of the ab-plane conductivity with c-axis LO<lb/> phonons. We did observe the difference in contribution<lb/> of LO phonons to the ab plane reflectance with different<lb/> propagation directions, an effect first observed by Reedyk<lb/> et al., <ref type="biblio">[35]</ref> and also seen in the k c vs. k ⊥ c spectra ob-<lb/>tained by Tanner&apos;s group. <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref> In Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> the reflectance<lb/> with E a and k c, is compared with the reflectance<lb/> with E ab and k a, with the La 1.87 Sr 0.13 CuO 4 sample<lb/> at room temperature. There is an extra feature observed<lb/> at 500 cm −1 in the spectra with k c. Further evidence<lb/> that the c-axis LO phonons couples to ab plane features<lb/> can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>. The comparison between peaks in<lb/> the effective scattering rate at 450 cm −1 and 580 cm −1 to<lb/> the peaks in Im(-1/ǫ c ) shows the same strong correlation<lb/> seen in many other cuprates. <ref type="biblio">[35]<lb/></ref> For completeness we also plot the effective mass of un-<lb/>derdoped samples at low temperatures(Fig. <ref type="figure">8c</ref>) and high<lb/> temperatures(Fig. <ref type="figure">9c,d</ref>). As expected, m * (ω)<lb/> me<lb/> rises to a<lb/> maximum ≈ 3 forming a peak at ≈ 400 cm −1 . The en-<lb/>hancement of the effective mass in the pseudogap state<lb/> as well as the upper limit of m * (ω)<lb/> me<lb/> are similar to what<lb/> has been previously reported for Y123, Y124 and Bi2212.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[31]<lb/></ref> Before closing we compare our results with data of Gao<lb/> et al. <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref> on La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ films and Quijada et al.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref> on oxygen doped La 2 CuO 4+δ . Our results in the un-<lb/>derdoped case are comparable with those of the oxygen<lb/> doped material, although Quijada et al. did not carry out<lb/> a frequency dependent scattering rate analysis for their<lb/> underdoped sample. The film results of Gao et al. are<lb/> quite different from our findings. The films used in that<lb/> study had a strontium level that would correspond to<lb/> optimal doping in crystals. However, the 1/τ (ω) curves<lb/> deviate markedly from what we observe for slightly under<lb/> and overdoped samples. The authors performed an ex-<lb/>tended Drude analysis and found a strongly temperature<lb/> dependent scattering rate even at low temperatures. This<lb/> is in sharp contrast to our results which would suggest<lb/> a very weak temperature dependence in this tempera-<lb/>ture region. Based on our work, their samples should be<lb/> in the pseudogap state since they have an x value near<lb/> optimal doping. Comparing these results with other sys-<lb/>tems, in particular with Tl2202, two factors suggest the<lb/> possibility that the films may be overdoped. First, their<lb/> T c was near 30 K, lower than that expected for optimal<lb/> doping. Secondly, it is known that the oxygen level in<lb/> films can vary substantially and in LSCO oxygen can<lb/> have a major influence on the doping level <ref type="biblio">[36]</ref>. On the<lb/> other hand, we cannot completely rule out the possibility<lb/> that all the crystal results are affected by the polishing<lb/> process, and that the films better represent the bulk ma-<lb/>terial. It is clearly important to measure films where the<lb/> oxygen content is controlled by selective annealing.<lb/></p>

			<p>gion, taken on two underdoped single-layered high-T c su-<lb/>perconductors, shows clear evidence of a pseudogap state<lb/> in both the scattering rate and conductivity along CuO 2<lb/> planes. This pseudogap state extends to higher tempera-<lb/>tures than that observed in the multi-layered underdoped<lb/> cuprates such as YBCO and BSCO.<lb/></p>

			<p>The scattering rate is similar for both systems in the<lb/> pseudogap state. At low frequencies, ω ≤ 700 cm −1 , the<lb/> scattering rates are temperature dependent and change<lb/> with frequency in a non-linear fashion. Above 700 cm −1<lb/> this behavior becomes linear. Within experimental un-<lb/>certainty the observed high frequency scattering rate of<lb/> the underdoped sample is not affected by temperature up<lb/> to certain temperature T * * . This temperature is equal to<lb/> 200 K in case of La 1.87 Sr 0.13 CuO 4 and 150 K in case of<lb/> La 1.86 Sr 0.14 CuO 4 . Above T * * the high frequency scat-<lb/>tering rate is temperature dependent. This behavior is<lb/> identical to the high-frequency effective scattering rate of<lb/> an overdoped HTSC. <ref type="biblio">[31]<lb/></ref> Our findings in the direction perpendicular to the<lb/> CuO 2 planes showed that the depression of the c-axis<lb/> conductivity is not as prominent as the one found in the<lb/> two layer HTSC. Nevertheless, the signature of the pseu-<lb/>dogap can be seen at the frequencies below 500 cm −1 up<lb/> to room temperature.<lb/></p>
