			<p>Tunneling and ARPES experiments which<lb/> are sensitive to either the interface of the<lb/> junction or surface of the sample have suggested<lb/> a dominant d-wave pairing symmetry in<lb/> hole-doped cuprate superconductors <ref type="biblio">[1,2]</ref>. Still,<lb/> low-temperature specific heat (C) is thought to<lb/> be one of the unique experiments which provide<lb/> evidence of d-wave pairing in bulk properties.<lb/></p>

			<p>The T 2 temperature dependence of the electronic<lb/> term in C at zero magnetic field H=0 and the<lb/> H 1/2 dependence of the linear term coefficient g<lb/> have been interpreted as strong evidence of the<lb/> line nodes of order parameter <ref type="biblio">[3-12]</ref>. Very<lb/> recently, the scaling behavior of the electronic<lb/> specific heat contribution C e (T,H) has been<lb/> predicted by theory <ref type="biblio">[13,14]</ref>, and confirmed by<lb/> experiments <ref type="biblio">[5,9-11]</ref>. However, several papers<lb/> reported that the non-linear H dependence of g<lb/> was<lb/> also<lb/> observed<lb/> in<lb/> conventional<lb/> superconductors <ref type="biblio">[15,16]</ref>, and raised the question<lb/> whether the H 1/2 dependence of g is indeed due<lb/> to d-wave pairing. In addition, although most<lb/> studies of C(T,H) in cuprates agree on the H 1/2<lb/> dependence of g, there remains controversies on<lb/> the existence of the T 2 term at H=0. <ref type="biblio">Chen</ref> et al.<lb/> have presented data showing clear evidence of<lb/> the T 2 t e rm i n L a 1.78 Sr 0.22 CuO 4 and<lb/> disappearance of this T 2 term in H, both<lb/> consistent with the predictions for d-wave<lb/> superconductivity [5]. Nevertheless, in some<lb/> other works, evidence of the T 2 term was either<lb/> ambiguous or had to be identified through<lb/> sophisticated fit [6-10]. These difficulties make<lb/> the C(T,H) studies of the impurity-doped<lb/> cuprate superconductors particularly of interest.<lb/> If the recently developed theory [17-19] of the<lb/> impurity scattering effects on the quasiparticle<lb/> excitation in cuprates can be verified by C(T,H)<lb/> measurements, it would strongly indicate that<lb/> the observed properties of C(T,H) are<lb/> characteristic of d-wave pairing. These studies<lb/> may also help to improve the theories of the<lb/> quasiparticles in cuprates. Furthermore, since a<lb/> small impurity scattering rate can cause<lb/> disappearance of the T 2 term, it is desirable to<lb/> know the magnetic field dependence of C(T,H)<lb/> in the impurity-doped cuprates. Comparisons<lb/> between C(T,H) of the nominally clean samples<lb/> and that of the impurity-doped ones may<lb/> generate fruitful implication on the existing<lb/> puzzles.<lb/> T o<lb/> s e rv e<lb/> t h e s e<lb/> pu rpos e s ,<lb/> La 1.78 Sr 0.22 Cu 1-x Ni x O 4 samples were chosen for<lb/> two main reasons. C of the Ni-doped samples<lb/> has a much smaller magnetic contribution than<lb/> that of the Zn-doped samples, and the data<lb/> analysis can be simplified. Moreover,<lb/> La 1.78 Sr 0.22 CuO 4 has been compellingly shown to<lb/> be a clean d-wave superconductor [5], and is<lb/> ideal to compare with the Ni-doped samples.<lb/> Polycrystalline samples of La 1.78 Sr 0.22 Cu 1-x Ni x O 4<lb/> with nominal x=0, 0.01, and 0.02 were carefully<lb/> prepared from La 2 O 3 , SrCO 3 , and CuO powder<lb/> of 99.999% purity. Details of the preparation<lb/> were described elsewhere [5]. The powder<lb/> x-ray-diffraction patterns of all samples used in<lb/> the experiments show a single T phase with no<lb/> detection of impurity phases. The transition<lb/> temperature T c by the midpoint of the resistivity<lb/> drop is 28.7, 21.2 and 17.4 K for x=0, 0.01, and<lb/> 0.02, respectively. The transition width (90% to<lb/> 10% by the resistivity drop) of T c is 3 K or less<lb/> for all samples, suggesting a decent homogeneity.<lb/></table>

			<p>C(T) was measured from 0.6 to 9 K with a 3 He<lb/> thermal relaxation calorimeter using the<lb/> heat-pulse technique. The precision of the<lb/> measurements in the temperature range is about<lb/> 1%. To test the calibrations of the thermometer<lb/> and the measurements in H, a copper sample was<lb/> measured, and the scatter of data in different<lb/> magnetic fields is about 3% or better. Details of<lb/> the calorimeter calibrations by the copper<lb/> sample can be found in Ref. <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The analysis of C(T,H) was carried out for<lb/> data from 0.6 to 7 K. Varying the temperature<lb/> range to 8 K or to 6 K does not lead to any<lb/> significant change of the results. Both the<lb/> individual-field and global fit have been<lb/> executed, and give similar results and conclusion.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this Letter, the results from the<lb/> individual-field fit are reported. Data of all<lb/> samples are described by<lb/></p>

				<formula>C(T,H)=g(H)T+bT 3 +<lb/> n C S=2 (T,H)<lb/></formula>

				<label>(1)<lb/></label>

			<p>where bT 3 is the phonon contribution and nC S=2<lb/> is the magnetic contribution of spin-2<lb/> paramagnetic centers (PC&apos;s) associated with<lb/> CuO 2<lb/> p l a n e s<lb/> [ 2 0 -22].<lb/> Since<lb/> La 1.78 Sr 0.22 Cu 1-x Ni x O 4 has only CuO 2 planes and<lb/> lacks CuO chains, nC S=2 was used rather than the<lb/> conventional Schottky anomaly, which was<lb/> thought to be related to CuO Chains <ref type="biblio">[7,22]</ref>.<lb/> Phenomenologically, inclusion of nC S=2 also<lb/> yields a better fit than that of the Schottky<lb/> anomaly.<lb/></p>

				<p>C(T,0) of samples with x=0, 0.01 and 0.02<lb/> is shown in Fig. 1. For x=0, at zero field C/T vs.<lb/> T 2 shows an obvious downward curve at low<lb/> temperatures due to the T 2 term in C. For x=0.01,<lb/> this downward curve becomes a straight line<lb/> except below 1 K where the contribution from<lb/> the magnetic contribution becomes important.<lb/></p>

			<p>An increase in g with increasing x can also be<lb/> recognized directly from data shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Both disappearance of the T 2 term and the<lb/> increase in g are considered as manifestations of<lb/> the impurity scattering. The low-temperature<lb/> upturn in C/T of both x=0.01 and 0.02 can be<lb/> attributed to nC S=2 by the solid lines resulted<lb/> from the fit by Eq. <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>. To further show the<lb/> quality of the fit in H, C(T,H) of x=0.01 at low<lb/> temperatures is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a)</ref> as an example,<lb/> together with the solid lines representing the fit<lb/> of data to Eq. <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>. The results illustrate that<lb/> C(T,H) of L a 1.78 Sr 0.22 Cu 1-x Ni x O 4 can be<lb/> satisfactorily described by Eq. <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>. The<lb/> contribution of nC S=2 compared with other terms<lb/> is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. As expected, n resulting from<lb/> the fit does not change significantly with H,<lb/> however with variation in H³4 T as shown in<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">2(b)</ref>. Similar results of n vs. H can be found<lb/> in all three samples. It is likely that the effective<lb/> Hamiltonian for C S=2 in Ref. <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref> results from<lb/> the experimental data with H&lt;4 T <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>, and is<lb/> most suited for low magnetic fields. From the<lb/> low-field fitting results, n of x=0, 0.01, and 0.02<lb/> is about 0.3, 0.9, and 1.8´10 -4 respectively. The<lb/> value of n for x=0 is taken from the fit of the<lb/> data in H and implemented into the fit at H=0.<lb/></p>

			<p>The solid line for x=0 in Fig. <ref type="figure">1(a)</ref> shows that the<lb/> data can accommodate a small nC S=2 .<lb/></p>

			<p>For a clean d-wave superconductor in a<lb/> finite field H, an increase in g is predicted to be<lb/> proportional to H 1/2 at low temperatures due to<lb/> the Doppler shift on the quasiparticle energy<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[3,4]</ref>. In the unitary limit, impurity scattering<lb/> leads to a modification to the density of states,<lb/> and the H dependence of g becomes <ref type="biblio">[17-19]<lb/></ref></p>

				<formula>g(H)=g(0)(1+D´(H/H c2 )´ln(H c2 /H))<lb/></formula>

				<label>(2)<lb/></label>

			<p>where D»D 0 /32G. D 0 is the superconducting gap,<lb/> G is the impurity scattering rate, and H c2 is the<lb/> upper critical field. The unitary limit is widely<lb/> considered as a good approximation to the nature<lb/> of the impurity scattering in cuprates, and is<lb/> supported by experimental evidences. To<lb/> compare g(H) of the clean sample with that of<lb/> the Ni-doped ones, g vs. H 1/2 of all samples was<lb/> plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. If g has a H 1/2 dependence as<lb/> expected in a clean sample, the data will follow<lb/> a straight line as represented by the dash line in<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 4. Indeed, data of the sample with x=0<lb/> indicate a clear H 1/2 dependence of g (Fig. 4(a)).<lb/></figure>

		<p>In Ni-doped samples, the H dependence of g is<lb/> smaller than in the clean one, and the data show<lb/> a pronounced curvature for small H (Fig. <ref type="figure">4(b)<lb/> and (c)</ref>). This behavior makes g(H) of Ni-doped<lb/> samples distinct from that of the clean one. Thus<lb/> the effect of the impurity scattering is<lb/> distinguished. Actually, g(H) of both Ni-doped<lb/> samples can be well described by Eq. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> with<lb/> reasonable parameters as shown by the solid line<lb/> in Fig. 4(b) and (c). The fit gives G/D 0 =0.020<lb/> and 0.025 for x=0.01 and 0.02, respectively, with<lb/> H c2 »38 T. A twice increase in G/D 0 is expected<lb/> for x=0.02 by the nominal doping concentration;<lb/> nevertheless, this small increase in G/D 0 is in<lb/> accord with a less rapid T c suppression in the<lb/> x=0.02 sample. Furthermore, as a result of the<lb/> impurity scattering, the values of g/g n<lb/> corresponding to those of G/D 0 are in good<lb/> agreement with the calculated values in Refs.<lb/> [17,18] for both Ni-doped samples. On the other<lb/> hand, a try to fit g(H) of the clean sample by Eq.<lb/> <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> has proven to be fruitless and resulted in a<lb/> unrealistic H c2 &gt;1000 T.<lb/></p>

			<p>The most crucial test of the recent theory<lb/> for a d-wave superconductor with impurities<lb/> probably lie on the breakdown of the scaling<lb/> behavior of C e (T,H)ºC(T,H)-g(H=0)T-bT 3 -nC S=2 .<lb/></p>

			<p>For a clean d-wave superconductor, if C e /(TH 1/2 )<lb/> vs. H 1/2 /T is plotted, all data at various T and H<lb/> should collapse into one scaling line according<lb/> to the recent scaling theory <ref type="biblio">[13,14]</ref>. This scaling<lb/> of C e (T,H) has been observed in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7-d<lb/> and La 1-x Sr x CuO 4 samples <ref type="biblio">[5,9-11]</ref>. As shown in<lb/> Fig.<ref type="figure">5 (a)</ref>, C e (T,H) of La 1.78 Sr 0.22 CuO 4 follows<lb/> this scaling. However, a recent theory predicts<lb/> that strong impurity scattering can cause<lb/> breakdown of the scaling <ref type="biblio">[17,23]</ref>. This dramatic<lb/> effect is best illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">5(b) and (c)</ref>. In<lb/> contrast to the scaling of C e (T,H) of the clean<lb/> sample, C e (T,H) data of Ni-doped samples split<lb/> into individual isothermal lines as predicted by<lb/> the numerical calculations <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The very theory also suggests that Eq. <ref type="formula">(2)<lb/></ref> is exact only in fields H&lt;H * where H * /H c2 »G/D 0<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[17,18]</ref>. Though, g(H) should not deviate Eq. <ref type="formula">(2)<lb/></ref> too much if H is slightly larger than H * <ref type="biblio">[24]</ref>. In<lb/> case of H&gt;&gt;H * , g(H) would mimic the H 1/2<lb/> behavior <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. With H * »1 T in the present<lb/> experiments, g(H) in Fig. <ref type="figure">4(b) and (c)</ref> behaves<lb/> exactly like what is expected. In small H, the<lb/> weak magnetic field dependence is well<lb/> described by Eq. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>. In large H, the data do not<lb/> obey Eq. (1) as well as in small H, and a<lb/> distinction between Eq. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> and the H 1/2<lb/> dependence is less easily made. Therefore, the<lb/> less satisfactory fit in high fields merely reflects<lb/> the limit of Eq. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> as expected from the theory.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is noted that n of the spin-2 PC&apos;s<lb/> increases with the doping concentration x.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, it is unlikely that the magnetic<lb/> contribution in C(T,H) comes directly from the<lb/> Ni ions since n is two order of magnitude<lb/> smaller than x. Recently, it has been reported<lb/> that the nominal magnetic Ni ions do not disturb<lb/> the spin correlation in CuO 2 planes even on Ni<lb/> sites at small x in overdoped cuprates <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref>. In<lb/> both C and susceptibility c measurements, no<lb/> paramagnetic contribution from Ni was observed.<lb/></p>

			<p>C reported in this Letter and the related<lb/> preliminary studies on c are consistent with<lb/> these results <ref type="biblio">[26]</ref>. The larger nC S=2 in the<lb/> Ni-doped samples probably comes from the<lb/> defects in CuO 2 planes, which are induced by Ni<lb/> substitution. On the other hand, Zn substitution<lb/> has strong effects on C (and c). The large<lb/> magnetic contribution usually makes the studies<lb/> of the impurity scattering effects on C(T,H)<lb/> inconclusive <ref type="biblio">[27,28]</ref>. More detailed studies on<lb/> these novel properties of C and c in Ni-or<lb/> Zn-doped cuprates are desirable.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, the impurity scattering<lb/> effects on C(T,H) of d-wave superconductors<lb/> have been clearly identified. The weak H<lb/> dependence of g(H) in small magnetic fields and<lb/> the breakdown of the scaling behavior of C e (T,H)<lb/> both are consistent with predictions of the<lb/> present theory. It is thus suggested that the<lb/> unconventional features observed in C(T,H) of<lb/> either clean or impurity-doped cuprate<lb/> superconductors are intrinsic bulk properties of<lb/> d-wave superconductivity.<lb/></p>
