			<p>Among systems for controlled studies of the effect of<lb/> disorder on the properties of cuprate superconductors,<lb/> Zn-doped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (YBCO) is a particularly in-<lb/>teresting choice. Unlike most dopants, Zn substitutes<lb/> for Cu on the planes <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref> and causes significant changes<lb/> to the local electronic structure without much change<lb/> of hole concentration <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>. In the superconducting state<lb/> Zn substitution dramatically changes both the transition<lb/> temperature <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref> and the temperature dependence of the<lb/> low-temperature penetration depth <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. NMR and mag-<lb/>netization measurements in the normal state suggested<lb/> that Zn induces a weak magnetic moment µ ef f =0.32 to<lb/> 0.36 µ B /Zn for fully oxygenated crystals, and that this<lb/> moment increases as the oxygen content decreases <ref type="biblio">[3,5]</ref>.<lb/> An oxygen reduced sample (O 6.66 ) which exhibited a spin<lb/> gap showed a moment of 0.86µ B /Zn <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. A model in<lb/> which each Zn atom effects the local magnetic order of<lb/> nearby copper atoms on the scale of the magnetic cop-<lb/>per correlation length (which varies with δ) explains the<lb/> normal-state magnetic measurements on this system <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>.<lb/> In the superconducting state, NMR measurements sug-<lb/>gested that in Zn substituted YBCO there exists a finite<lb/> electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>.<lb/> Early specific heat measurements <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref> seemed to agreed<lb/> with this conclusion indicating increased DOS in the su-<lb/>perconducting state in Zn substituted samples.<lb/></p>

			<p>Simple valence counting suggests that if the Zn impu-<lb/>rity maintains a nominal Cu 2+ charge, the Zn 2+ would<lb/> have a (3d) <ref type="biblio">10</ref> , S=0 configuration and act as a nonmag-<lb/>netic impurity. Thus, it is important to understand<lb/> whether a nonmagnetic impurity can induce a local mo-<lb/>ment on the surrounding Cu 2+ sites. Early theoreti-<lb/>cal treatment of the problem expected that a nonmag-<lb/>netic impurity can only induce a local moment when the<lb/> &quot;mother&quot; phase has a spin gap <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. Further studies of<lb/> this problem concluded that in a doped antiferromag-<lb/>net with no spin gap an induced localized magnetization<lb/> will exist around the impurity but it does not correspond<lb/> to a free moment. At low enough temperatures where<lb/> the staggered correlation length is larger than the local-<lb/>ization length associated with the impurity distortion,<lb/> this localized moment is always aligned with the local<lb/> staggered order <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>. While the question of whether the<lb/> magnetic moments exist in a global sense and in par-<lb/>ticular whether the moments are observable below the<lb/> superconducting transition temperature is still an open<lb/> question, new theoretical ideas argue that the moments<lb/> may be partially screened below the spin gap and fully<lb/> screened deep in the superconducting state <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref> in the<lb/> cuprates. Recently, there has been some theoretical work<lb/> done considering the fact of a possible Kondo-screening.<lb/> In a conventional s-wave superconductor, the Kondo ef-<lb/>fect is suppressed by the formation of the superconduct-<lb/>ing gap, as shown by Abrikosov and Gorkov <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>. In d-<lb/>wave superconductors, however, there are quasiparticles<lb/> in the node lines which could cause a Kondo screening.<lb/> Indeed, Fradkin and Cassanello recently calculated the<lb/> thermodynamic properties of a d-wave superconductors<lb/> with magnetic impurities <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>. They predicted a screen-<lb/>ing mechanism analogous to the exchange coupling be-<lb/>tween magnetic impurities and the electrons in a Fermi<lb/> liquid that causes the Kondo effect. In the clean limit,<lb/> the Dirac like quasiparticles and the magnetic impurity<lb/> form a singlet state. The screening is only effective above<lb/> a critical exchange coupling , because in contrast to the<lb/> Kondo effect in metals, the density of states of normal<lb/> quasiparticles in a d-wave superconductor vanishes at the<lb/> Fermi surface. In this limit, the magnetic susceptibilty<lb/> disappears superlinearly, hence the effect can be consid-<lb/>ered as overscreening.<lb/></p>

			<p>Observing the effect of a low concentration of Zn dop-<lb/>ing on the magnetic behavior of the cuprates in the su-<lb/>perconducting state is practically impossible due to the<lb/> strong signal associated with the vortex state. However,<lb/> applying a magnetic field will split the free Zn-induced<lb/> moments into a two-level system and a Schottky anomaly<lb/> should be apparent in the low temperature specific heat.<lb/> In the present paper we provide a comprehensive study<lb/> of the effect of Zn impurities on the behavior of low-lying<lb/> electronic excitations in YBCO. To this end we study<lb/> the specific heat of pure, 0.15%, 0.31% and 1% Zn-doped<lb/> single crystals YBCO samples. We extend earlier mea-<lb/>surements on Zn-doped polycrystalline YBCO samples.<lb/> Compared to pure YBCO we find that: i) The linear-T<lb/> term, which has been regularly observed in specific heat<lb/> measurements of YBCO <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> is greatly increased. This<lb/> result is only qualitatively consistent with the &quot;dirty d-<lb/>wave&quot; scenario <ref type="biblio">[16,17]</ref> used to explain the penetration<lb/> depth measurements and the suppression of T c . ii) The<lb/> T 3 term decreases, suggesting either a surprisingly large<lb/> increase in the Debye temperature or a new electronic<lb/> contribution with a similar temperature dependence. iii)<lb/> A low temperature upturn T −2 below ∼3.5 K is observed.<lb/> This upturn is seen in many specific heat measurements<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref> , though , its origin is still unclear. iv) The most<lb/> intriguing result of our measurements is that there is no<lb/> apparent increase in the number of free magnetic mo-<lb/>ments as indicated by a Schottky anomaly in any of the<lb/> Zn-doped samples as compared with the pure sample.<lb/> Normal state measurements of the magnetization of the<lb/> 1% sample is in agreement with previous measurements<lb/> indicating a magnetic moment of the size ∼0.36 µ B /Zn.<lb/> From these results, we conclude that the magnetic mo-<lb/>ments that exist in the normal state must be screened at<lb/> low temperatures in the superconducting state.<lb/></p>

			<p>Pure and Zn-doped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.95 (optimally doped)<lb/> single crystals were grown by a flux-growth technique.<lb/> The detailed process and the characterization of the sam-<lb/>ples is described in <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. The Zn concentration was deter-<lb/>mined by comparing T c of the crystals to powder sam-<lb/>ples with known Zn concentration and annealed at the<lb/> same conditions. This method gives an accuracy of 0.01<lb/> -0.02% Zn per Cu. With increasing Zn-doping, the T c<lb/> is suppressed by ∆T c ∼12K/% Zn. Magnetic measure-<lb/>ments showed that in our 1% sample the T c is suppressed<lb/> by 12 K. Specific heat data were taken using the relax-<lb/>ation method, which especially allows the measurement<lb/> of relatively small samples. The addenda heat capacity<lb/> of the calorimeter was measured independently and sub-<lb/>tracted from the sample measurements. A more detailed<lb/> description is found elsewhere <ref type="biblio">[15,19]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Specific heat data on the Zn-doped YBCO crystal were<lb/> taken between 2 and 12 K at zero field and between 2 and<lb/> 8 K at 0.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 Tesla. The specific heat was<lb/> measured as a function of temperature at constant mag-<lb/>netic field which was applied above T c before cooling the<lb/> sample. The zero-field results are shown in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, plot-<lb/>ted as c(T )/T vs. T 2 and compared with pure (0% Zn)<lb/> samples. In this representation, for a normal metal, the<lb/> slope β is the coefficient of the lattice T 3 term and the<lb/> intercept γ is the coefficient of the linear electronic heat<lb/> capacity and proportional to its density of states. Devi-<lb/>ations from this γT + βT 3 behavior are not very notice-<lb/>able for the nominally pure sample, but with increasing<lb/> Zn concentration the samples show a low-temperature<lb/> upturn below ∼3 K. Also, from a visual observation,<lb/> the curves for the Zn-doped samples have larger γ, and<lb/> smaller β suggesting higher electronic density of states<lb/> and higher Debye temperatures with increasing Zn con-<lb/>centration. While the cause of the low-temperature up-<lb/>turn is still unknown, there are some indications that it<lb/> is related to interaction between paramagnetic impurities<lb/> and a local field <ref type="biblio">[18,20]</ref> or a result of collective behavior<lb/> of these impurities <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. This is supported by our finding<lb/> that this upturn is somewhat influenced by the quality of<lb/> the sample. Previous reports of early samples of YBCO,<lb/> showed a much larger low-temperature upturn in the spe-<lb/>cific heat, thus, a straightforward fitting of the data at<lb/> higher temperatures (e.g. ≥ 5 K) to avoid the upturn will<lb/> result in misleading values of both the γT term and the<lb/> βT 3 term <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. Although the &quot;upturn effect&quot; is not too<lb/> large below 3.5 K, and does not effect our overall data,<lb/> we still include it in our analysis as discussed below.<lb/></p>

			<p>The magnetic field dependence is shown in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> for<lb/> the 1% Zn sample. The lower Zn concentration samples<lb/> show similar behavior. The most notable result here is<lb/> the further increase in the extrapolated intercept with<lb/> the c(T )/T axis, an indication of further increase in the<lb/> quasi-particles density of states upon the application of<lb/> magnetic field. Based on our previous results on pure<lb/> YBCO crystals <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> we first attempt the general fit:<lb/></p>

				<formula>c(T, H = 0) = A(0)/T N + γ(0)T + βT 3 ,<lb/> c(T, H ≥ 0.5T ) = A(H)/T N + γ(H)T + βT 3<lb/> +c Sch (T, H)<lb/></formula>

				<label>(1)<lb/></label>

			<p>where we omitted the T 2 term for the Zn doped samples<lb/> as we no longer expect to have clean lines of nodes, and<lb/> we attempt to account for the uncertainty in the upturn<lb/> by allowing the power law used to describe it to vary<lb/> as T −N where N=1,2. In these equations, β is field in-<lb/>dependent and the βT 3 term is assumed to result from<lb/> phonons. c Sch (T, H) is a Schottky anomaly associated<lb/> with a field-independent molar concentration ν Sch of free<lb/> spin-1/2 moments. Finally, we have a free function γ(H).<lb/></p>

			<p>For pure samples, the coefficient of this linear-T term is<lb/> found to obey γ(H) = γ(0) +γ(H) where γ(0) decreases<lb/> as twin boundaries and oxygen vacancies are removed<lb/> from the crystal (for O 6.99 , γ(0) ∼ 1 mJ/mol-K 2 ), and<lb/> γ(H) ∝ H 1/2 with a coefficient which agrees semiquan-<lb/>titatively with the prediction for lines of nodes <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>. For<lb/> the low temperature upturn, in fitting only the zero-field<lb/> data, the best fit was obtained with N=2. However, a<lb/> global fit using data of all fields for a given Zn concen-<lb/>tration results in a best fit with N=1. As our results and<lb/> in particular the conclusions based on the results were<lb/> not sensitive to the choice of N, we used N=1 in all of<lb/> the following data analyses. In general we found that<lb/> the field dependence of the 1/T low temperature upturn<lb/> is not consistent with increasing spin-1/2 impurities: it<lb/> does not change dramatically with applied field and does<lb/> not become a Schottky-like term either. The coefficients<lb/> that we obtained in this fit are given in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Starting our analysis with the effect of Zn-doping on<lb/> β , we find that β = 0.308, 0.284, and 0.274 mJ/mol-K 4<lb/> for the 0.15%, 0.31% and 1% Zn doped samples respec-<lb/>tively, as compared with 0.392± 0.001 mJ/mol-K <ref type="biblio">4</ref> for<lb/> the nominally pure sample. If this T 3 term is only asso-<lb/>ciated with phonons, it corresponds to an increase in the<lb/> Debye temperature from 403 K in the nominally pure<lb/> sample to 454 K in the 1% Zn-doped sample. Such a<lb/> large increase is very surprising and may indicate that<lb/> a portion of the T 3 term is electronic in nature. The<lb/> linear term, γ(0)T , also increases with Zn doping. The<lb/> zero-field linear-T term increases from 3.0 mJ/mol-K 2 in<lb/> the nominally pure sample to 4.3, 5.8 and 11.7 mJ/mol-<lb/>K 2 in the 0.15%, 0.31% and 1% Zn doped samples re-<lb/>spectively. Assuming a normal state linear T coefficient<lb/> γ n ∼20 mJ/mol-K 2 , this implies a residual density of<lb/> states ratios n res = N (E F )/N n of 0.066, 0.14, and 0.43<lb/> for the three crystals (here N (E F ) is the density of states<lb/> at the Fermi level and N n is the density of states in the<lb/> normal state that results in that γ n ). From penetration<lb/> depth measurements of crystals from the same batches<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>, an analysis based on a &quot;dirty d-wave&quot; <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref> found a<lb/> scattering parameter Γ/T c ≃ 0.018-0.030 for 0.31% Zn<lb/> doping and Γ/T c ≃ 0.006-0.009 for the 0.15% Zn dop-<lb/>ing. In the limit of strong resonant scattering the dirty<lb/> d-wave model predicts Γ ∝ n 2<lb/> res with a logarithmic cor-<lb/>rection of order ln(T c n res /Γ) . Ref. <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref> shows reasonable<lb/> agreement with that prediction using penetration depth<lb/> data of 0.15% and 0.31%. To analyze the specific heat<lb/> we first need to estimate the &quot;Zn-like&quot; impurities in the<lb/> nominally pure sample. Again, the penetration depth<lb/> of similar samples give a scattering parameter Γ/T c of<lb/> about 0.0008 which corresponds to an impurity concen-<lb/>tration of 0.013% and a residual density of states ratio of<lb/> 0.03, which implies a contribution of ∼0.6 mJ/mol-K 2 to<lb/> the zero-field linear term. The residual ∼2.4 mJ/mol-K 2<lb/> most probably come from the unfilled chains as was found<lb/> by measuring the high oxygen content crystals <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. Us-<lb/>ing the above data figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the change of the zero<lb/> field linear term from the Zn-free sample ( ∆γ(0) ) as<lb/> a function of the Zn concentration. For comparison we<lb/> also show in figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> the expected ∆γ(0) expected from<lb/> &quot;dirty d-wave&quot; theory <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>. While as for the penetration<lb/> depth data, the low Zn concentration fits the &quot;dirty d-<lb/>wave&quot; theory reasonably well, stronger deviation appears<lb/> for the 1% sample indicating a more linear dependence<lb/> on the Zn concentration. Table <ref type="table">I</ref> summarizes the results<lb/> presented above.<lb/></p>

			<p>For pure samples, the field dependent coefficient of the<lb/> linear-T term obeys γ(H) = γ(0) +γ(H). Whileγ ∝<lb/> H 1/2 for pure samples, Zn doping alters this behavior and<lb/> the 1% Zn sample showedγ ∝ H as is shown in figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.<lb/> This suppression of the H 1/2 term was expected because<lb/> of increased scattering. In Volovik&apos;s work <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>, the H 1/2<lb/> magnetic field dependence of the density of states results<lb/> from the use of the intervortex spacing as a cutoff to the<lb/> spatial integral over the density of states in the vortex.<lb/> For the large Zn concentration such as our 1% sample we<lb/> expect a much shorter cutoff length. In the unitary limit<lb/> the scattering rate at low frequencies (and temperatures)<lb/> saturates at a value ℓ ∼ v F n res /2Γ <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>. Using our results<lb/> for Γ we find that this length is of order 100Å, thus<lb/> explaining the linear field dependence.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally we turn to the search of the Zn induced mag-<lb/>netic moments. As noted in the introduction the Zn-<lb/>induced impurities are expected to be observed in finite<lb/> magnetic field specific heat measurements. For a two-<lb/>level system this is a Schottky-like anomaly given by:<lb/></p>

				<formula>c Sch (T, H) = ν Sch R<lb/> ∆<lb/> k B T<lb/> 2<lb/> e<lb/> ∆<lb/> k B T<lb/> 1 + e<lb/> ∆<lb/> k B T<lb/> 2<lb/></formula>
				<label>(2)<lb/></label>

			<p>where ∆ is the size of the two-level system gap. Clearly a<lb/> true two level system exists for spin 1/2 impurities only.<lb/> In the case of Zn impurities we expect an effective mo-<lb/>ment of order one Bohr-magneton <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>, hence, a simplified<lb/> two-level system with a moment µ and a gap ∆ = 2µH<lb/> should be a good approximation for the expected efect<lb/> on the specific heat. Also in equation 2, ν Sch is the mo-<lb/>lar concentration of moments and R is the gas constant.<lb/> Impurity moments are always found in specific heat mea-<lb/>surements of high-T c materials even for &quot;pure&quot; crystals.<lb/> For optimally doped YBCO a concentration of about<lb/> 0.05% -0.1% per copper atom is found <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. For higher<lb/> oxygen concentration this number is smaller providing us<lb/> with evidence that most of these moments come from un-<lb/>compensated copper atoms in the chains. As mentioned<lb/> above, it has been argued that Zn impurities induce mo-<lb/>ments that for the concentration range and oxygen level<lb/> of our samples is expected to be µ = 0.32µ B to 0.36µ B<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. Thus, it is easy to calculate the expected Schottky<lb/> anomaly associated with the Zn moments; in particular<lb/> we expect that since the Zn moments originate from the<lb/> Cu-O planes and the &quot;unaccounted&quot; spin-1/2 moments<lb/> come from the chains the Zn contribution will simply<lb/> be an addition to the pure crystal heat capacity. With<lb/> the above introduction, the most surprising result is that<lb/> we did not find any change in the Schottky anomaly for<lb/> any of the Zn doping all the way to 8 Tesla, the maxi-<lb/>mum field we measured. This result can most dramat-<lb/>ically be seen in figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> where the specific heat data<lb/> at 8 Tesla is plotted together with the calculated Schot-<lb/>tky anomaly expected for 1% Zn with magnetic moment<lb/> per Zn of µ = 0.32µ B (the smaller expected contribu-<lb/>tion). Also plotted in figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> is a Schottky anomaly with<lb/> µ = 1.28µ B , displaying the possibility of a &quot;composite&quot;<lb/> moment that results from local ferromagnetic interaction<lb/> of moments on four neighboring oxygen atoms <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. If a<lb/> significant amount of either 0.32µ B or 1.28µ B moments<lb/> were present, it would be readily apparent in the size of<lb/> the Schottky anomaly, which is unchanged from undoped<lb/> samples. Fitting with a Schottky term with 1.28µ B mo-<lb/>ments in addition to the 1µ B -spin-1/2 anomaly finds no<lb/> more than 0.02% additional spins per Cu and is con-<lb/>sistent with no 1.28µ B moments at all. At 0.32µ B per<lb/> moment, the presence of 1% spins per Cu would create a<lb/> Schottky tail which wouldn&apos;t roll over at even the high-<lb/>est fields and lowest temperatures measured. However,<lb/> this upturn would increase proportionally to the square<lb/> of the applied field, being 16 times larger at 8 Tesla than<lb/> at 2 Tesla. Assuming that all of the low temperature up-<lb/>turn in the 8 Tesla data is from a small-moment Schottky<lb/> anomaly, we obtain an upper limit of 0.03% spins per Cu,<lb/> for 0.32µ B moment spins. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> highlights this dis-<lb/>crepancy, showing that even with different fitting meth-<lb/>ods, there are few, if any, of the Zn impurities creating<lb/> free magnetic moments in the crystal.<lb/></p>

			<p>The absence of Zn-induced magnetic moments in the<lb/> superconducting state may be explained in two ways.<lb/> The first is that the moments exist only in a local sense<lb/> and thus will be found in local measurements such as<lb/> Knight shift but will be missed in bulk measurements<lb/> such as the present specific heat due to the &quot;spread&quot;<lb/> of the moment throughout the whole sample <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>. To<lb/> check for this hypothesis we measured the susceptibility<lb/> of the 1%-Zn doped sample. A weak Curie behavior was<lb/> found which is of similar magnitude to that measured by<lb/> Zagoulaev et al. <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref> implying a similar size of magnetic<lb/> moment per Zn impurity. The fact that the Zn-moments<lb/> exist in the normal state may be explained by the fact<lb/> that we have been measuring a doped Heisenberg antifer-<lb/>romagnet which is close to optimal doping, and for which<lb/> the spin gap has not collapsed yet.<lb/></p>

			<p>The second possibility for the &quot;disappearance&quot; of the<lb/> moments is that they are screened in a Kondo fashion.<lb/> Such a possibility was recently considered by Nagaosa<lb/> and Lee <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref> and by Cassanello and Fradkin <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>. Rele-<lb/>vant to our measurements is the Cassanello and Fradkin<lb/> work in which they postulated that magnetic impurities<lb/> in a clean d-wave superconductor will be screened, and<lb/> show that the screening can be described as a multichan-<lb/>nel non-marginal Kondo problem. For simplicity they as-<lb/>sume spin-1/2 impurities that are located on the Cu sites<lb/> in the planes. Using expected values of the exchange cou-<lb/>pling, they find a critical temperature T K ∼ 10 K, below<lb/> which the impurities will be overscreened. Their calcu-<lb/>lation of the low-temperature specific heat yielded the<lb/> expressions:<lb/></p>

				<formula>c(T, H) = 9ζ(3)ν i RN c δ 2 T<lb/> T K<lb/> 2<lb/> ln<lb/> ∆ 0<lb/> k B T<lb/> f ork B T &gt; µH<lb/> c(T, H) =<lb/> π 2<lb/> 3<lb/> ν i RN c δ 2 T<lb/> T K<lb/> µ B H<lb/> k B T K<lb/> ln<lb/> ∆ 0<lb/> µ B H<lb/></formula>

				<label>(3)<lb/></label>

			<formula>f ork B T &lt; µH<lb/></formula>

			<p>Here ν i is the impurity concentration per mole, R is the<lb/> universal gas constant, ζ(3) is the Rieman zeta function<lb/> of argument 3, N c is the rank of the symmetry group of<lb/> the impurity spin, taken to be 2 in the relevant case (see<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref> for details), δ is a dimensionless parameter related<lb/> to the strength of the screening ( the singlet amplitude),<lb/> ∆ 0 is the maximum gap of the d x 2<lb/> −y 2 superconductor,<lb/> and T K is the Kondo temperature associated with the<lb/> impurities. Before presenting our fit to the Cassanello<lb/> and Fradkin&apos;s calculation we note that the calculation<lb/> are based on a very simple model that assumes that the<lb/> quasiparticles that screen the moments come from the<lb/> nodes only. However, Zn impurities cause the depression<lb/> of the order parameter close to the impurity site due to<lb/> potential scattering (i.e. pair breaking). This effect is the<lb/> main cause of the depression of T c , and was not included<lb/> in the calculations. However, all the effects related to<lb/> Zn scattering are local in nature and thus should reduce<lb/> to a generalized Andreev boundary condition (general-<lb/>ized because of the different symmetries that may be in-<lb/>volved, including inter-node scattering and so on). It is<lb/> very unlikely that these effects will help in the Kondo<lb/> screening since these potentials are invariant under spin<lb/> rotations <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>. With the above discussion in mind we<lb/> fitted our Zn-doped specific heat data with the screen-<lb/>ing model, i.e. equations 3. Since the model provides us<lb/> with the limiting cases only for temperature and fields we<lb/> first fit the high field, assuming that all the field depen-<lb/>dence comes from the screening. We then introduce an<lb/> interpolation function that is exponential in nature which<lb/> connects the low and high magnetic fields. We show the<lb/> results of the fit in figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> while the fitting parameters<lb/> are shown in TABLE <ref type="table">II</ref>. Again, compared with Zn-free<lb/> sample the Schottky anomaly does not change, the T 3<lb/> contribution is smaller and a small low temperature up-<lb/>turn is observed. For the 1%Zn we find (δ/T K )= 0.0082,<lb/> a value within the range discussed in <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>. For that sam-<lb/>ple we also find that the quality of the fit degrades at<lb/> high fields, possibly due to the model becoming invalid<lb/> with the relatively large DOS at the nodes and its si-<lb/>multaneous smearing by the Zn doping and the magnetic<lb/> field. For the 0.31%Zn the value (δ/T K )= 0.003 seems<lb/> somewhat low as we expected to first approximation that<lb/> the two values will be the same.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, we presented in this paper a comprehen-<lb/>sive study of the low temperature heat capacity of Zn-<lb/>doped YBCO single crystals. Several trends have been<lb/> found as a function of Zn doping. The T 3 term decreases<lb/> with increasing Zn while the liner term increasing, in-<lb/>dicating an increasing DOS at the nodes. This residual<lb/> density of states is only qualitatively consistent with a<lb/> d-wave resonant scattering theory. The 1%Zn clearly de-<lb/>viates from the theoretical expectation, showing excess<lb/> DOS. A low temperature upturn is consistently observed<lb/> for the Zn-doped samples, similar to early measurements<lb/> on more disordered YBCO samples. The cause and exact<lb/> form of this upturn is still not clear. The most surprising<lb/> result of our study tough is that no Schottky anomaly<lb/> is observed for the presumed magnetic moments created<lb/> by Zn doping. Based on a recent theory by Cassanello<lb/> and Fradkin we fitted the data with Kondo screened mo-<lb/>ments. The relatively good quality of the fit and the rea-<lb/>sonable parameters extracted from it give us confidence<lb/> that indeed Zn-moments in YBCO crystals are screened<lb/> by quasiparticles in the nodes of the d x 2<lb/> −y 2 superconduc-<lb/>tor.<lb/></p>
