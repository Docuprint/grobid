			<p>In the cuprate high-temperature superconductors<lb/> (HTS), the canonical change in T c with pressure is that it<lb/> first increases, passes through a maximum value at some<lb/> critical pressure, and then decreases. <ref type="biblio">1,2</ref> It has been ar-<lb/>gued that there are at least two effects determining the<lb/> total pressure dependence of T c , an intrinsic effect and<lb/> the one that arises from the pressure-induced changes in<lb/> the charge carrier concentration. <ref type="biblio">1,2</ref> However, there are ef-<lb/>fects which make the discrimination between these contri-<lb/>butions difficult. In most HTS the application of pressure<lb/> doesn&apos;t simply compress the lattice, but also prompts<lb/> mobile oxygen defects to assume a greater degree of lo-<lb/>cal order. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> This leads to relaxation effects which are both<lb/> temperature and pressure dependent. An exception is the<lb/> double-chain compound YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 with a fixed oxygen<lb/> stoichiometry. Bucher et al. <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref> found that in this com-<lb/>pound T c increases under hydrostatic pressure with the<lb/> rate dT c /dp ≃ 5.5 K/GPa. Subsequent studies revealed<lb/> that with increasing pressure T c passes through a maxi-<lb/>mum around 9 GPa and then decreases. <ref type="biblio">1,2,3</ref> Furthermore,<lb/> measurements of the in-plane penetration depth λ ab of<lb/> YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 revealed pressure induced changes which<lb/> cannot be simply attributed to the pressure changes of<lb/> T c . <ref type="biblio">5,6</ref> Since in cuprate high-temperature superconduc-<lb/>tors, including YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 , the critical regime where<lb/> thermal critical fluctuations dominate is experimentally<lb/> accessible, various critical properties are not independent<lb/> but related by universal realtions. <ref type="biblio">7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14</ref> Ac-<lb/>cordingly, the isotope or pressure effects on these quanti-<lb/>ties are related as well. <ref type="biblio">11,14</ref> Here we explore the universal<lb/> relationship between the pressure effects on transition<lb/> temperature T c , volume V and anisotropy γ emerging<lb/> from the pressure induced changes of the magnetization<lb/> near T c . It is shown that in the underdoped YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8<lb/> the pressure effect on T c mirrors essentially that on the<lb/> anisotropy. This uncovers a novel generic property of<lb/> anisotropic type II superconductors, inexistent in the<lb/> isotropic case.<lb/></p>

			<p>The polycrystalline YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 samples were synthe-<lb/>sized by solid-state reactions using high-purity Y 2 O 3 ,<lb/> BaCO 3 and CuO. <ref type="biblio">5</ref> The hydrostatic pressure was gen-<lb/>erated in a copper-beryllium piston cylinder clamp that<lb/> was especially designed for magnetization measurements<lb/> under pressure. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> The sample was thoroughly mixed with<lb/> Fluorient FC77 (pressure transmitting medium) with a<lb/> sample to liquid volume ratio of approximately 1/6. The<lb/> pressure was measured in situ by monitoring the T c shift<lb/> of the small piece of In [T c (p = 0) ≃ 3.4K] included in the<lb/> pressure cell. The field-cooled magnetization measure-<lb/>ments were performed with a Quantum Design SQUID<lb/> magnetometer at temperatures ranging from 2 to 100K.<lb/> In Fig. <ref type="figure">1(a)</ref> we displayed the field-cooled (0.5 mT) mag-<lb/>netization M of a YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 powder sample vs. T near<lb/> T c for various applied hydrostatic pressures (0.0 kbar,<lb/> 2.67 kbar, 4.29 kbar, 7.52 kbar, and 10.2 kbar). To iden-<lb/>tify the temperature regime where critical fluctuations<lb/> play an essential role it is instructive to consider the be-<lb/>havior of dM/dT vs. T displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure">1(b)</ref>. With<lb/> decreasing temperature dM/dT is seen to raise below<lb/> the transition temperature and after passing a maximum<lb/> value it decreases. This behavior contradicts the mean-<lb/>field behavior where dM/dT below T c adopts a constant<lb/> value. <ref type="biblio">16</ref> It implies that the fluctuation dominated regime<lb/> is accessible and attained. This calls for an analysis be-<lb/>yond the mean-field approximation as outlined below.<lb/></p>

		<p>The detailed description of the scaling analysis adopted<lb/> for magnetization changes caused by isotope substitution<lb/> or applying pressure can be found in Refs. 17 and 18.<lb/> Briefly, the basic principles of the analysis can be summa-<lb/>rized as follows. When three-dimensional (3D) Gaussian<lb/> or 3D-XY thermal fluctuations dominate, the combina-<lb/>tion m (T, δ, H) / γǫ 3/2 (δ) T<lb/> √<lb/> H adopts at T c a fixed<lb/> value <ref type="biblio">8,9,10,12<lb/></ref></p>

			<p>As the pressure effect on the magnetization at fixed mag-<lb/>netic field is concerned it implies that the relative shifts<lb/> of the magnetization M , volume V , magnetization per<lb/> unit volume m, anisotropy γ and T c are not independent<lb/> but close to T c related by<lb/></p>

		<p>seen that the rise of T c mirrors essentially the decrease of<lb/> the anisotropy. Indeed the relative volume change is an<lb/> order of magnitude smaller. Furthermore, from Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>,<lb/> showing ∆T c /T c and ∆γ/γ versus p for the estimates<lb/> listed in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, it is seen that in the pressure range<lb/> considered here, both ∆T c /T c and ∆γ/γ depend nearly<lb/> linearly on pressure. Thus, under pressure not only T c<lb/> and the volume changes but the anisotropy is modified as<lb/> well. A quick glance to Table I reveal that the pressure<lb/> effect on T c mirrors essentially that on the anisotropy.<lb/> In addition, recent in-plane penetration depth λ ab mea-<lb/>surements revealed that there is a pressure effect on this<lb/> important property also. <ref type="biblio">5</ref> It was shown that the in-plane<lb/> penetration depth data of YBa 2 Cu 2 O 8 is consistent with<lb/> 3D-XY critical behavior, <ref type="biblio">5</ref> where the penetration depth<lb/> and correlation length in direction i diverge near T c as<lb/> λ 2<lb/> i (T ) = λ 2<lb/> i0 t −ν and ξ i (T ) = ξ i0 t −ν with t = 1 − T /T c<lb/> and ν ≃ 2/3. Moreover, as listed in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, the critical<lb/> amplitude λ −2<lb/> ab0 was found to be pressure dependent. The<lb/> consistency with 3D-XY critical behavior implies that<lb/> the transition temperature T c and the critical amplitudes<lb/> of the in-plane penetration depths λ ab0 and the c-axis<lb/> correlation lengths ξ c0 are not independent but related<lb/> by <ref type="biblio">7,8,9,10,14,20<lb/></ref></p>

				<label>(8)<lb/></label>

			<p>Universality implies that this relation holds irrespective<lb/> of the applied pressure. Thus, in addition to Eq.(6) the<lb/> pressure induced relative changes are then related by<lb/></p>

				<formula>∆T c<lb/> T c<lb/> = −2<lb/> ∆λ ab0<lb/> λ ab0<lb/> +<lb/> ∆ξ c0<lb/> ξ c0<lb/></formula>

				<label>(9)<lb/></label>

				<formula>∆γ<lb/> γ<lb/> =<lb/> ∆ξ ab0<lb/> ξ ab0<lb/> −<lb/> ∆ξ c0<lb/> ξ c0<lb/> .<lb/></formula>

				<label>(10)<lb/></label>

			<p>Using then the estimates for ∆T c /T c and −2∆λ ab0 /λ ab0<lb/> the relative change ∆ξ c0 /ξ c0 is readily calculated with<lb/> aid of Eq. <ref type="formula">(9)</ref>, while the values for ∆ξ ab0 /ξ ab0 follow from<lb/> relation <ref type="biblio">(10)</ref>. The values of ∆ξ c0 /ξ c0 and ∆ξ ab0 /ξ ab0 are<lb/> listed in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.<lb/></p>

		<p>From the scaling analysis of the pressure effect on mag-<lb/>netization and in-plane penetration depth it then emerges<lb/> that the rise of the transition temperature of underdoped<lb/> YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 with increasing pressure is associated with a<lb/> decreasing anisotropy and volume V . The relative change<lb/> of the transition temperature ∆T c /T c is seen to mirror<lb/> essentially that of the anisotropy ∆γ/γ. This is consis-<lb/>tent with the generic behavior for high-temperature su-<lb/>perconductors, where for a given HTS family T c increases<lb/> with reduced aniostropy. <ref type="biblio">10,13,14</ref> Although these changes<lb/> are small compared to those in the critical amplitudes<lb/> of the in-plane penetration depth ∆λ abo /λ abo and the<lb/> correlation lengths ∆ξ ab0 /ξ ab0 , ∆ξ c0 /ξ c0 (see Table <ref type="table">I</ref>)<lb/> it becomes clear that the pressure induced change of the<lb/> anisotropy is the essential ingredient which remains to be<lb/> understood microscopically. Empirically the anisotropy<lb/> decreases rather steeply by approaching optimum doping<lb/> and levels off in the overdoped regime. <ref type="biblio">10,13,14</ref> Together<lb/> with Eq.(6) this explains why the pressure effect on T c<lb/> becomes very small in optimally and overdoped cuprate<lb/> superconductors. <ref type="biblio">1,2,3</ref></p>
