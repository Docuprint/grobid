			<p>The large body of vital spectroscopic data on the high-T c superconducting compound<lb/> Y 1 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (YBCO) measured in the far infrared (FIR) as well as the GHz-region has revealed<lb/> many interesting features. Among them are: the presence of one <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref> or more <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref> energy gaps in<lb/> the superconducting state, a temperature dependent penetration depth that is indicative of d-wave<lb/> pairing <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>, and a quasiparticle scattering rate which is proportional to frequency in the normal state<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref> and which drops by four orders of magnitude at T c <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The new technique of THz-time-domain spectroscopy bridges the gap between the FIR and the<lb/> GHz regime. THz measurements of YBCO display a peak in the temperature dependence of σ 1 below<lb/> T c , which appears to be related to a temperature-dependent scattering rate 1/τ rather than to BCS<lb/> coherence effects <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. Other experiments using the same technique have revealed that the penetration<lb/> depth λ L , has a temperature-dependence inconsistent with BCS theory <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Here we report results of a THz investigation into the Y 1−x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YPrBCO) system.<lb/> These measurements are of great interest because samples covering a wide range of critical tem-<lb/>peratures can be obtained simply by varying the Y/Pr ratio <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>. Also, because YPrBCO is fully<lb/> stoichiometric in the oxygen content, it is more homogeneous than oxygen-depleted YBCO and does<lb/> not change from an orthorhombic to a tetragonal lattice upon decreasing T c . Several mechanisms<lb/> have been proposed for the T c suppression, including a magnetic pair breaking effect <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref> and depletion<lb/> of holes in the CuO 2 planes <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Recently, the opening of a spin gap at temperatures above T c in oxygen-deficient YBCO has been<lb/> deduced from various experiments e.g. dc resistivity and Hall coefficient <ref type="biblio">[10,11]</ref>, neutron scattering<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>, and NMR measurements <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>. However, until now only one electro-magnetic measurement on<lb/> underdoped YBCO has been linked to the presence of a spin gap <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. In this paper, we report evidence<lb/> for a spin gap obtained from measurements both at dc and at THz frequencies in YPrBCO, which is<lb/> consistent with Pr depleting holes from the CuO planes <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our spectroscopic technique involves a coherent time-domain measurement of a ps microwave<lb/> impulse E(t) transmitted through the sample <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>. A Fourier transform yields the complex transmis-<lb/>sion spectrum t(ω) and the complex conductivity σ(ω), without the use of Kramers-Kronig analysis.<lb/></p>

			<p>The London penetration depth λ L (T ), the plasma frequency ω p in the clean limit, and the scattering<lb/> time τ (T ) are obtained with the aid of a two-fluid model.<lb/></p>

			<p>The microwave source is a biased 30 µm transmitting antenna fabricated on low temperature<lb/> grown GaAs, triggered with ∼100 fs optical pulses from a colliding-pulse modelocked dye laser. The<lb/> emitted microwave pulses have spectral components spanning the 0.1 -1.0 THz spectral region which<lb/> is difficult to access with conventional electronics <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. The receiver is a 30 µm antenna, fabricated<lb/> on ion-implanted silicon-on-sapphire and gated with a second pulse from the laser. The receiver<lb/> photocurrent is proportional to the incident microwave field.<lb/></p>

			<p>We investigated five YPrBCO samples having Pr composition x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 1.0. The<lb/> films are grown by pulsed laser deposition <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref> onto NdGaO 3 substrates. The film thicknesses are<lb/> approximately 150 nm (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>). NdGaO 3 is the ideal substrate because it remains transparent and<lb/> nondispersive over the entire spectral bandwidth of our pulses, as well as over the entire range of<lb/> temperatures investigated here. The excellent lattice match of NdGaO 3 to YPrBCO is a prerequisite<lb/> for a low density of misfit dislocations on the film-substrate interfaces. The substrates have a (001)<lb/> orientation, yieldingĉ oriented, twinned films. The critical temperatures T dc<lb/> c (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>) are determined<lb/> from the temperature dependent resistivity, as measured with a four-point probe.<lb/></p>

			<p>To calculate the conductivity, we make use of the multiple reflection formula for the field trans-<lb/>mitted through a layer of (complex) index n 2 , thickness d, bounded by media of index n 1 and n 3 :<lb/></p>

				<formula>t(ω) =<lb/> t 12 t 23 exp(in 2 (ω/c)d)<lb/> 1 + r 12 r 23 exp(2in 2 (ω/c)d)<lb/></formula>

				<label>(1)<lb/></label>

		<p>where t ij = 2n i /(n i + n j ) is the field transmission coefficient at the ijth interface, and r ij =<lb/> (n i − n j )/(n i + n j ) is the field reflection coefficient. In our geometry, n 1 represents vacuum,<lb/> n 2 = 1 + iσ(ω)/(ǫ 0 ω) is the index of the superconducting layer, and n 3 is the measured index<lb/> of the substrate. As n 2 (ω/c)d ≪ 1, and n 2 ≫ n 3 &gt; 1 in our samples, Eq. <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> reduces to<lb/></p>

				<formula>t(ω) =<lb/> 1 + n 3<lb/> 1 + n 3 + Z o σ(ω)d<lb/></formula>

				<label>(2)<lb/></label>

			<p>where Z 0 is the impedance of free space.<lb/></p>

			<p>The effect of varying Pr content x (hereafter [Pr]) on the conductivity spectra σ(ω) at T = 50 K<lb/> is similar to the effect of varying the temperature for a given alloy (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The addition of Pr has<lb/> at least two interrelated effects: a) The suppression of T c changes the partitioning between normal<lb/> and superconducting carriers. b) The total number of carriers N (or their mobility) may be reduced.<lb/></p>

			<p>To the extent that the superconducting carriers make the largest contribution to σ 2 , both factors a)<lb/></p>

			<p>and b) lead one to expect that at a given temperature, pure YBCO would have the largest σ 2 , and<lb/> it does. Samples with 20% and 30% Pr have smaller values of σ 2 , since they are only slightly below<lb/> their T c . The sample with 40% Pr has σ 2 ≈ 0 because it is above T c at 50 K.<lb/></p>

			<p>Only normal carriers contribute to σ 1 for ω = 0, but now factors a) and b) compete. At 50 K,<lb/> σ 1 decreases with [Pr], therefore the effect of a reduction in N dominates the effect of the shift in T c<lb/> which increases the fraction of normal carriers. The data for pure YBCO and 20% Pr have been fit<lb/></p>

			<p>to a frequency-dependent Drude form, and one can see that 1/τ lies in our spectral range. For 30%<lb/> and 40% Pr, we observe frequency independent σ 1 and can conclude that 1/τ is large compared to<lb/> 1 THz. Pure PrBCO is a dielectric at 50 K, as seen by a conductivity proportional to frequency, i.e.<lb/> a dielectric constant independent of frequency.<lb/></p>

			<p>Examining σ 2 at a fixed frequency, e.g. 480 GHz, we see that it is close to zero at high temperature,<lb/> but rises sharply at the onset of superconductivity, thus providing an independent ac measurement<lb/> of T c (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In all of the superconducting alloys, below T c , σ 1 displays a peak, which has been previously<lb/> observed only in fully oxygenated YBCO using microwave techniques <ref type="biblio">[5,17]</ref> as well as measuring the<lb/> thermal conductivity <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. It has been attributed to a sharp rise in the scattering time τ of normal<lb/> carriers below T c offsetting the decrease in the fraction of normal carriers, although coherence effects<lb/> remain a possibility. For pure YBCO, the peak value is about 20 times higher than σ 1 (100 K).<lb/></p>

			<p>With increasing [Pr] the peak height in σ 1 decreases but the temperature corresponding to the peak<lb/> position does not shift significantly.<lb/></p>

			<p>The normal state behavior of our samples is particularly interesting because underdoped materials<lb/> such as (124)YBCO and oxygen deprived (123)YBCO undergo a phase transition associated with<lb/> the opening of a spin gap at a temperature T D &gt; T c . Evidence for the presence of a spin gap has<lb/> been seen in neutron scattering <ref type="biblio">[12,19]</ref>, as well as in dc resistivity measurements <ref type="biblio">[10,11]</ref>. Recent<lb/> experimental <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref> and theoretical <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref> work confirms that YPrBCO alloys are also underdoped, i.e.<lb/> superconductivity is suppressed, because holes are removed from the CuO 2 planes.<lb/></p>

			<p>If the normal carriers couple strongly to spin fluctuations, the opening of a spin gap should be<lb/> accompanied by an increase in the scattering time τ , giving rise to an enhancement in σ 1 below T D<lb/> for ω &lt; 1/τ . For pure (optimally doped) YBCO, at 480 GHz, σ 1 shows only a single transition at<lb/> T c (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). For the (underdoped) alloys, σ 1 has two transitions, one at T c , the other at a higher<lb/> temperature which increases with [Pr]. To accentuate the two transitions, Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref> is shaded in the<lb/> region bounded by T c , the experimental curve, and a dashed line representing 1/(α + βT ) behavior.<lb/></p>

			<p>The higher transition temperature seen at 480 GHz matches that of a transition also observed in<lb/> the dc resistivity (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). The transition is manifested as a deviation from a linear T dependence.<lb/></p>

			<p>To show the deviation more clearly, the resistivity is first fit to a line ρ = α + βT between 250<lb/> and 300 K, and then the experimental values are normalized to the value determined by the line as<lb/> follows:<lb/></p>

				<formula>ρ * =<lb/> ρ<lb/> α + βT<lb/></formula>

				<label>(3)<lb/></label>

			<p>The normalized resistivity (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>) of the YPrBCO alloys clearly shows a transition occurring at a<lb/> temperature above T c similar to that which has been observed in underdoped YBCO, and connected<lb/> to the opening of a spin gap <ref type="biblio">[10,11]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>For the evaluation of λ L we are using a two fluid model of the form:<lb/></p>

				<formula>σ(ω) =<lb/> ǫ 0 ω 2<lb/> p τ<lb/> 1 − iωτ<lb/> x n +<lb/> 1<lb/> µ 0 λ 2<lb/> L<lb/> −πδ(ω) +<lb/> i<lb/> ω<lb/> x s ,<lb/></formula>

				<label>(4)<lb/></label>

			<p>where ω p is the plasma frequency, and x n and x s are the fractions of normal and superconducting<lb/> carriers, given by x n +x s = 1. We derive the penetration depth from a fit to Eq. <ref type="formula">(4)</ref>. In our frequency<lb/> range, we can ignore the Drude contribution to σ 2 for temperatures which are more than a degree<lb/> below T c . As x n = 0 at T = 0 in the two-fluid scenario, we have x s = (λ L (0)/λ L (T )) 2 . Shown in<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> is the measured (λ L (0)/λ L (T )) 2 vs. T /T ac<lb/> c for all samples. Also plotted are theoretical curves<lb/> from weak-coupling BCS theory <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref> and the functional form<lb/></p>

				<formula>(λ L (0)/λ L (T )) 2 = 1 − (T /T c ) α .<lb/></formula>

				<label>(5)<lb/></label>

			<p>Power-law behavior in the dependence of λ L on T for T → 0 is one signature of &quot;unconventional<lb/> superconductivity&quot;, i.e. nodes in the energy gap in k-space <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>. Our data are intermediate between<lb/> BCS theory and α = 2, which is the exponent predicted for d-wave pairing with impurity scattering<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref>. Microwave measurements at lower frequencies have indicated both α = 1 (in the T → 0 limit)<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[3,24]</ref> and α = 2 <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. The Gorter-Casimir two-fluid model (α = 4) <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref>, as well as d-wave pairing<lb/> (α = 1) are clearly inconsistent with our data.<lb/></p>

			<p>λ L (0) is obtained by extrapolating λ L (T ) to T = 0 using a quadratic regression (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>). Our<lb/> value for pure YBCO, 168 ± 2 nm, is close to the 145 nm value typical for good samples <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. λ L (0)<lb/> increases with increasing [Pr] as the samples become less superconducting.<lb/></p>

			<p>The plasma frequency ω p (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) is determined with the relation ω p = c/λ L (0), which is valid<lb/> in the clean limit, provided all carriers are superconducting at T = 0. The clean limit assumption<lb/> becomes less valid upon substitution of Pr, therefore the values for the alloys are only estimates.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our value of 9500 cm −1 in pure YBCO is close to the 12000 cm −1 value indicative of good sample<lb/> quality <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>.<lb/></p>

		<p>The quasiparticle scattering rate is calculated by fitting Eq. <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> to the data for σ 1 and using, for<lb/> x n , the relation x n = 1 − x s = 1 − (λ L (0)/λ L (T )) 2 . We find that the scattering rate 1/τ decreases<lb/> slowly with decreasing temperature until T ≈ T c , after which it decreases exponentially rapidly<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), possibly reflecting the opening up of a gap in the fluctuation spectrum. Similar behavior<lb/> has been reported in YBCO samples <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. The scattering rate 1/τ reveals an exponential decay below<lb/> T c by more than two orders of magnitude for all samples with different [Pr] <ref type="biblio">[26]</ref>. Thus we are led to<lb/> conclude that this behavior is a universal feature of high-T c superconductivity.<lb/></p>

			<p>For T &gt; T c , we find the surprising result that 1/τ decreases with <ref type="biblio">[Pr]</ref> implying that alloy scattering<lb/> plays a negligible role, and that depletion of carriers in the CuO 2 planes dominates the scattering. It<lb/> should be noted, however, that the drop in 1/τ with [Pr] may be due to an underestimate of ω p , if the<lb/> clean limit assumption breaks down for the alloys. A more precise determination of the scattering<lb/> rate dependence on [Pr] above T c is beyond the scope of this letter.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, we have presented complex conductivity experiments in the THz range on thin<lb/> films of Y 1−x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 . σ 1 (T ) reveals the anomalous coherence peak for all superconducting<lb/> alloys. Both the conductivity in the THz region and dc resistivity measurements provide evidence<lb/> for the opening of a spin gap in the excitation spectrum of the underdoped samples. σ 2 (ω, T ) yields<lb/> directly the penetration depth. For the superconducting YPrBCO alloys the plasma frequency ω p in<lb/> the clean limit decreases with [Pr] above T c due to a reduced number of carriers. The temperature<lb/> dependent quasiparticle scattering rate 1/τ (T ) shows an exponential drop below T c in all the alloys.<lb/></p>

		<p>These observations fit into the picture of Pr suppressing superconductivity by depletion of the carrier<lb/> concentration in the superconducting CuO 2 planes.<lb/></p>
