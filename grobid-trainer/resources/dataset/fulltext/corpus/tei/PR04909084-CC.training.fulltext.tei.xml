			<p>The superconductor-to-nonsuperconductor transitions in cuprates, as functions of carrier<lb/> concentration, give insights into quantum phase transitions (QPT&apos;s) in general <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref> and into the<lb/> phenomenon of high temperature superconductivity in particular <ref type="biblio">[2-4]</ref>. On the underdoped side,<lb/> the transition is from superconducting to an insulating state with a (pseudo)gap in the electronic<lb/> excitation spectrum that remains finite through the QPT. The fundamental physics on the<lb/> overdoped side of the phase diagram is profoundly different because there is no pseudogap, the<lb/> superconducting gap becomes progressively smaller <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref> with doping, and the QPT is from<lb/> superconductor to a metal that looks like a conventional Fermi liquid in many respects.<lb/> Key issues are: (i) Are these transitions first-order or are they quantum critical points<lb/> (QCP) where quantum fluctuations of the order parameter are important? (ii) How does the<lb/> presence or absence of an energy gap impact the transitions? (iii) Are these transitions driven<lb/> by a collapse of the pairing amplitude or by fluctuations of the phase of the superconducting<lb/> order parameter? (iv) Does anisotropy (c-axis vs. ab-plane) affect the dimensionality of the<lb/> QCP&apos;s?<lb/> T c as a function of hole doping p takes a quasi-universal form <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>, with<lb/> superconductivity existing for 0.3 ≲ p ≲ 0.30, with a maximum at p  0.15, independent of the<lb/> maximum value of T c or of c vs. ab-plane anisotropy. Thus, one might expect a common<lb/> explanation for the over-and underdoped quantum phase transitions in different compounds.<lb/></p>

			<p>An early study of several underdoped cuprate compounds suggested that T c and<lb/> superfluid density [n s  λ -2 , λ = magnetic penetration depth] might be linearly proportional: T c<lb/>  λ -2 (0), with a universal slope as critical underdoping is approached <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>. This linear scaling led<lb/> to the widely accepted view that classical thermal phase fluctuations destroy superconductivity<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref> in underdoped cuprates when the superfluid density becomes small, even as the energy gap<lb/> remains intact. This long-standing view was overturned recently by measurements on severely<lb/> underdoped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7-δ (YBCO) films <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref> and crystals <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref> showing that scaling is actually<lb/> sublinear: T c  [λ -2 (0)] α with α  0.5. Sublinear scaling, together with the absence of critical<lb/> thermal fluctuations near T c , pointed to a 3D QCP <ref type="biblio">[2,3]</ref>. The QCP hypothesis was put to a<lb/> stringent test in a study of two-unit-cell-thick underdoped YBCO films that were 2D by<lb/> construction. Indeed, linear scaling expected near a 2D QCP was observed for these ultrathin<lb/> films <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The present work focuses on the overdoped QPT in La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO). While the<lb/> underdoped regime has been explored in several materials, studies in the overdoped regime<lb/> have focused largely on a single material: T 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+δ (T2201) <ref type="biblio">[11,12]</ref>. We are motivated to<lb/> study LSCO because it can be doped through both over-and underdoped quantum phase<lb/> transitions, and it is much less anisotropic than T2201, thus allowing us to address the key<lb/> question of the effective dimensionality of fluctuations. Our main results are:<lb/></p>

			<p>(1) All overdoped samples with high Sr concentrations, x &gt; 0.22, have sharp<lb/> superconducting-to-normal thermal phase transitions, as narrow as 200 mK near the<lb/> QPT. This suggests that the overdoped QPT is not dominated by inhomogeneity or<lb/> phase separation.<lb/></p>

			<p>(2) Near the overdoped QPT, we find sublinear scaling T c  [λ -2 (0)] α with α  0.5 for<lb/> LSCO, in contrast to the linear scaling (α  1.0) seen in T2201 <ref type="biblio">[11,12]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>(3) We argue that scaling with α  0.5 is consistent with either (a) a mean-field QPT driven<lb/> by gap collapse in a disordered d-wave superconductor, or (b) a 3D quantum critical<lb/> point (QCP). In case (a), asymptotically close to the QPT one must take into account<lb/> critical fluctuations. Case (b) permits us to reconcile the square-root scaling in LSCO<lb/> with the linear scaling in T2201.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 films were grown by MBE on (001) LaSrAlO 4 (LSAO) substrates <ref type="biblio">[13]<lb/></ref> (see Table <ref type="table">I</ref>). The films&apos; c-axes are perpendicular to the substrate. Compressive strain due to a<lb/> 0.6% lattice mismatch (a = 3.754 Ǻ for LSAO and 3.777 Ǻ for LSCO) gives our films a<lb/> maximum T c ( 44 K) several K above the maximum T c of LSCO crystals. Sr doping values are<lb/> nominal. They are set by atomic beam fluxes during deposition. Well after the first series of<lb/> films (d = 45 nm) was grown, we decided to grow two additional films, at x = 0.27 and 0.30 (d<lb/> = 90 nm; last two rows of Table <ref type="table">I</ref>). These films have somewhat higher resistivities, T c &apos;s and<lb/> superfluid densities than for the first series, possibly due to a different oxygen vacancy<lb/> concentration.<lb/></p>

			<p>Two samples were grown simultaneously at each Sr concentration, one on a narrow<lb/> substrate for measuring resistivity and the other on a 10100.35 mm 3 substrate for measuring<lb/> λ -2 . Sheet conductivity, σd = σ 1 d -iσ 2 d, was measured with a low-frequency (/2π = 50 kHz)<lb/> two-coil mutual inductance technique, with drive and pickup coils on opposite sides of the film<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>. Near T c , the real part of the conductivity σ 1 (T) has a peak that probes the spatial<lb/> homogeneity of T c . The imaginary part, σ 2 (T), yields the magnetic penetration depth λ via: λ -<lb/>2 (T) ≡ μ 0 σ 2 (T). λ -2 (T) is often loosely referred to as &quot;superfluid density&quot;, n s , since the two are<lb/> proportional.<lb/></p>

			<p>The ab-plane resistivities of our films decrease smoothly with doping, Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, achieving a<lb/> low residual resistivity of about 40 μ cm at the highest doping, comparable to that of a<lb/> similarly overdoped LSCO crystal <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. &quot;T c &quot; defined from where ρ ab vanishes, agrees within a<lb/> degree or so with &quot;T c &quot; defined from where superfluid appears.<lb/></p>

			<p>Figures <ref type="figure">2 and 3</ref> show λ -2 (T) for representative LSCO films, illustrating the qualitative<lb/> feature that λ -2 (T) for overdoped films has less downward curvature than for under-and<lb/> optimally-doped films. The same qualitative effect is seen in LSCO powders <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref> and in<lb/> T2201 powders <ref type="biblio">[11,12,17]</ref>. σ 1 is plotted as μ 0 σ 1 , (μ 0 = permeability of vacuum = 410 <ref type="biblio">-7<lb/></ref> H/m), to facilitate quantitative comparison with λ -2 ≡ μ 0 σ 2 . Peaks in σ 1 (T) (Figs. <ref type="figure">2 and 3</ref>)<lb/> probe film homogeneity. Films with x ≤ 0.21 have peaks with structure indicating the presence<lb/> of several closely-spaced T c &apos;s over the mm-scale area probed. On the other hand, films with x <lb/> 0.24 have single peaks about 1 K wide, e.g., the x = 0.30 film in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The peak is only 0.2 K<lb/> wide for the film closest to the QPT (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), consistent with good film homogeneity, although<lb/> there are other experiments <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref> suggesting a phase-separated overdoped superconducting state.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is important to establish the quality of our films by comparison with the literature. T c vs. x<lb/> for films (black squares in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) follows the usual path, peaking at x  0.15 and heading<lb/> toward zero at x  0.03 and 0.30. λ -2 (0) vs. x for films (red squares in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) tracks that of<lb/> LSCO powders (green circles) <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref> up to x  0.18. λ -2 (0) of our films decreases with strong<lb/> overdoping, with a peak near x  0.19, consistent with overdoped T2201<ref type="biblio">[11,12]</ref> and other<lb/> LSCO films <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>. Resistivity and superfluid density measurements show that our films are<lb/> essentially of the same quality as bulk samples.<lb/></p>

			<p>A detailed examination of how the magnitude and T-dependence of superfluid density<lb/> change across the phase diagram is presented elsewhere <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. Here we focus on scaling between<lb/> T c vs. λ -2 (0), Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Data from our under-and overdoped LSCO films are shown as open and<lb/> filled red squares, respectively. Data on other cuprates <ref type="biblio">[8,10]</ref> are shown for comparison (see<lb/> caption). The solid gray line representing square-root scaling is drawn through the underdoped<lb/> Ca-YBCO thick film data, but it is close to the underdoped LSCO data, too. The solid red line<lb/> representing square root scaling is drawn through the data for strongly overdoped LSCO films.<lb/></p>

			<p>The light blue line representing linear scaling is drawn through the data for two-unit-cell thick<lb/> Ca-doped YBCO.<lb/></p>

			<p>Let us ask why n s decreases with overdoping, even though the carrier density increases.<lb/></p>

			<p>The most natural explanation is the interplay between disorder (scattering rate 1/) and a d-<lb/>wave pairing interaction, and thus gap  0 , that weakens with overdoping. In a disordered d-<lb/>wave superconductor, a simple sum-rule argument suggests a linear suppression of n s (0) to zero<lb/> with increasing 1/ 0 borne out by detailed calculations <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>. In addition, the dirty d-wave T c<lb/> exhibits a square-root suppression to zero with 1/ 0 so that: T c ~ [λ -2 (0)] 1/2 . We note this<lb/> is a mean-field result, and for doping close enough to the QPT, the superfluid density<lb/> necessarily becomes so small that quantum phase fluctuations dominate the physics. It is not<lb/> known where the crossover to this asymptotic behavior occurs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Well-known scaling arguments predict <ref type="biblio">[1-3]</ref> that T c  [λ -2 (0)] α near a QCP, with<lb/> exponent α ≡ z Q /(z Q + D -2), where D = dimensionality and z Q = quantum dynamical exponent.<lb/></p>

			<p>Since z Q should not be less than unity, in D = 3 the smallest reasonable exponent is α = ½,<lb/> which is coincidentally the same as the dirty-d-wave mean field result. This describes the<lb/> observed nonlinear scaling in overdoped LSCO reasonably well.<lb/></p>

			<p>The QCP interpretation also permits us to understand the linear scaling in overdoped<lb/> T2201 <ref type="biblio">[11,12]</ref>. It is reasonable to expect 2D fluctuations in T2201, which is much more<lb/> anisotropic than LSCO. For D = 2, the exponent α = 1, independent of z Q . Thus the different<lb/> scalings seen in LSCO and T2201 can be attributed to the different dimensionalities of the<lb/> fluctuations.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is worth noting that there is experimental evidence for significant interlayer coupling<lb/> in overdoped LSCO. Ironically, this evidence comes from a 2D, Kosterlitz-Thouless-<lb/>Berezinski-like transition seen in the most overdoped film, i.e., the abrupt downturn in λ -2 near<lb/> the intersection of the KTB line with λ -2 (T) (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The slope of the KTB line in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> is<lb/> calculated assuming that the film fluctuates as a single 2D entity. For independently fluctuating<lb/> layers, the slope of the KTB line would be 70 times larger. Analogous features appear in<lb/> microwave measurements of σ in underdoped LSCO films <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>, indicating significant interlayer<lb/> coupling across the LSCO phase diagram. Finally, similar evidence for interlayer coupling is<lb/> found in &quot;thick&quot; underdoped YBCO films, which also show 3D critical scaling <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>In summary, we observe in overdoped LSCO that superconductivity diminishes with T c<lb/> ~ [λ -2 (0)] 1/2 . Taken by itself, this behavior may be viewed as a consequence of a mean-field gap<lb/> collapse in a disordered d-wave superconductor. On the other hand, if one seeks a common<lb/> explanation for the nonlinear scaling in LSCO and the linear scaling in T2201, then one is led<lb/> to the interpretation that the scaling observed for strongly overdoped samples is due to 3D and<lb/> 2D quantum critical points, respectively. The difference in dimensionality would be due to the<lb/> much higher anisotropy of T2201. Finally, in moderately underdoped LSCO we observe<lb/> nonlinear T c vs. λ -2 (0) scaling that is quantitatively similar to that of underdoped YBCO.<lb/> However, data on severely underdoped LSCO samples are needed to establish a 3D QCP on the<lb/> underdoped side.<lb/></p>
