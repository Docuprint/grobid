			<p>The strong temperature dependence of the Hall coef-<lb/>ficient R H of the high-T c cuprates has been considered<lb/> to be one of the most peculiar properties of their un-<lb/>usual normal state <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. The rather complex behavior <ref type="biblio">[2]<lb/></ref> of R H (T ) can be turned into a simpler one by looking at<lb/> the cotangent of the Hall angle <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>, cot θ H ≡ ρ xx /ρ xy ; it<lb/> has been shown that cot θ H of cuprates behaves approx-<lb/>imately as T 2 , regardless of material <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref> and carrier con-<lb/>centration <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>. This remarkable simplicity in the behavior<lb/> of cot θ H led to the idea <ref type="biblio">[3,5]</ref> that cot θ H reflects a Hall<lb/> scattering rate τ −1<lb/> H , which is different from the scattering<lb/> rate τ −1<lb/> tr governing the diagonal resistivity ρ xx . There are<lb/> two physical pictures to account for this apparent sepa-<lb/>ration of the scattering rates: One picture considers that<lb/> two distinct scattering times τ tr and τ H , possibly asso-<lb/>ciated with different particles, govern different kinds of<lb/> scattering events <ref type="biblio">[5,6]</ref>. The other picture considers that<lb/> the scattering time is strongly dependent on the position<lb/> on the Fermi surface (FS) and that ρ xx and cot θ H are<lb/> governed by the scattering events on different parts of<lb/> the FS <ref type="biblio">[2,7]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Separately from the above development, it has be-<lb/>come a common understanding <ref type="biblio">[8,9]</ref> that in underdoped<lb/> cuprates a pseudogap in the density of low-energy excita-<lb/>tions is developed at a temperature much higher than the<lb/> superconducting transition temperature T c . In under-<lb/>doped YBCO, the in-plane resistivity ρ ab shows a clear<lb/> downward deviation from the T -linear behavior below a<lb/> temperature T * , which has been discussed to mark the<lb/> onset of the pseudogap <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. This T * is notably higher<lb/> than the other characteristic temperature T g determined<lb/> from the onset of a suppression in the Cu NMR relax-<lb/>ation rate <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>, which has also been associated with the<lb/> pseudogap. The presence of two different temperature<lb/> scales, T * and T g , is intriguing. It was proposed recently<lb/> that at the upper temperature scale T * the CuO 2 plane<lb/> starts to develop local antiferromagnetic correlations <ref type="biblio">[8]<lb/></ref> or charged stripe correlations <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>; the lower tempera-<lb/>ture scale T g corresponds to the opening of a more ro-<lb/>bust pseudogap in the density of states <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>, which can be<lb/> observed by the angle-resolved photoemission <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref> or by<lb/> the tunneling spectroscopy <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>It was previously discussed <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref> that the pseudogap<lb/> causes a deviation from the T −1 behavior in R H (T ) at<lb/> T * . The conspiring changes in ρ ab (T ) and R H (T ) at T *<lb/> leave the T 2 behavior of cot θ H unchanged at T * , which<lb/> led to the belief that cot θ H is rather insensitive to the<lb/> opening of the pseudogap. However, given the recent<lb/> understanding that the pseudogap has two characteristic<lb/> temperatures T * and T g , it is left to be investigated how<lb/> cot θ H (T ) behaves around T g .<lb/></p>

			<p>Since the pseudogap effect is expected to be related to<lb/> the antiferromagnetic fluctuations <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>, there have been ef-<lb/>forts to investigate how the pseudogap feature is affected<lb/> by Zn doping onto the CuO 2 planes, which produces spin<lb/> vacancies. The reported Zn-doping effects on the pseu-<lb/>dogap are not simple; for example, the pseudogap fea-<lb/>ture in ρ ab (T ) in underdoped YBCO crystals is almost<lb/> unchanged <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>, while the suppression in the Cu NMR<lb/> relaxation rate below T g is diminished with only 1% of<lb/> Zn <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>. To build a complete picture of the pseudogap<lb/> effect, it is also useful to investigate how the Zn doping<lb/> affects the pseudogap in the Hall channel.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this paper, we report the results of our measure-<lb/>ments of the Hall effect in YBa 2 (Cu 1−z Zn z ) 3 O y crys-<lb/>tals with y=6.78, which corresponds to an underdoped<lb/> concentration. At this composition y=6.78, which gives<lb/> T c ≃75 K in pure crystals, a peak in R H (T ) can be clearly<lb/> seen and also the pseudogap feature in ρ ab (T ) is clearly<lb/> discernible (due to the rather wide T -linear region above<lb/> T * ); from the literature, we can infer that T * is about<lb/> 200 K (Ref. <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>) and T g is about 130 K (Ref. <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>). Our<lb/> measurements of three samples with different Zn concen-<lb/>trations (z=0, 0.006, and 0.013) found that a deviation<lb/> from the T 2 behavior in cot θ H takes place in all the sam-<lb/>ples at the same temperature T 0 which is very close to<lb/> T g , indicating that the pseudogap indeed affects cot θ H<lb/> near T g and that the effect is robust against Zn doping.<lb/></p>

			<p>There have been several publications reporting the ef-<lb/>fect of Zn doping on R H in YBCO, but the results are<lb/></p>

			<p>not converged. The data by Chien, Wang, and Ong indi-<lb/>cate that R H of optimally-doped crystals increases with<lb/> increasing z in the whole temperature range above T c<lb/> and the T dependence becomes less pronounced <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref> [it is<lb/> possible that in their samples the effective carrier con-<lb/>centration is changing, because the slope of ρ ab (T ) is in-<lb/>creasing with z]. Mizuhashi et al. reported that R H<lb/> increases over the whole temperature range with z (al-<lb/>most like a parallel shifting), while the slope of ρ ab (T ) in<lb/> the T -linear part is unchanged <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. On the other hand,<lb/> Walker, Mackenzie, and Cooper reported that, in their<lb/> Zn-doped crystalline thin films, R H at 300 K remains<lb/> essentially unchanged, while at low temperatures R H is<lb/> progressively suppressed with increasing z <ref type="biblio">[2,18]</ref>. In the<lb/> present work, we therefore paid particular attention to<lb/> reduce the errors in the measurement of R H ; the Hall<lb/> voltage is measured with magnetic-field sweeps at con-<lb/>stant temperatures, and errors due to the geometrical<lb/> factors are minimized by making small voltage contacts<lb/> and by determining the sample thickness with a high ac-<lb/>curacy. We note that making the voltage contacts on the<lb/> side faces (not on the top face) of the crystals is essential<lb/> in reducing the error and increasing the reproducibility.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Zn-doped YBCO single crystals are grown by a<lb/> flux method using pure Y 2 O 3 crucibles <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>. All the crys-<lb/>tals measured here are naturally twinned. The oxygen<lb/> content is tuned to y=6.78 by annealing the crystals with<lb/> pure YBCO powders in air at 575 • C for 37 h, and subse-<lb/>quent quenching to room temperature. The final oxygen<lb/> content is confirmed by iodometric titration. The actual<lb/> Zn concentration in the crystals are measured with the<lb/> inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry with an<lb/> error in z of less than ±0.001.<lb/></p>

			<p>The measurements are performed with a low-frequency<lb/> (16 Hz) ac technique. Longitudinal and transverse volt-<lb/>ages are measured simultaneously using two lock-in am-<lb/>plifiers during the field sweeps at constant temperatures.<lb/> For the transverse signal, we achieved a high sensitivity<lb/> by subtracting the offset voltage at zero field (the offset<lb/> comes from a slight longitudinal misalignment between<lb/> the two Hall voltage contacts). The temperature is stabi-<lb/>lized using a high-resolution resistance bridge with a Cer-<lb/>nox resistance thermometer. We confined the maximum<lb/> magnetic field to 4 T, with which the error of the Cer-<lb/>nox thermometer caused by its own magnetoresistance is<lb/> negligibly small in the temperature range of the present<lb/> study. The magnetic field is applied along the c-axis of<lb/> the crystals. To enhance the temperature stability, the<lb/> sample and the thermometer are placed in a vacuum can<lb/> with a weak thermal link to the outside. The achieved<lb/> stability in temperature during the field sweeps is better<lb/> than a few mK. The data are taken from −4 T to +4 T,<lb/> and then the asymmetrical component is calculated to<lb/> obtain the true Hall voltage. The final accuracy in the<lb/> magnitude of R H and ρ ab reported here is estimated to<lb/> be better than ±5%, and the relative error in the data<lb/> for each sample is less than ±2%.<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the temperature dependence of ρ ab for<lb/> the three Zn concentrations. Above ∼200 K, ρ ab of all<lb/> the three samples shows a good T -linear behavior and<lb/> the slope of this T -linear part does not change with z.<lb/></p>

			<p>As shown in the inset to Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, a downward deviation<lb/> from the T -linear dependence takes place at the same<lb/> temperature for all the three samples, indicating that the<lb/> upper pseudogap temperature T * does not change with<lb/> z. This result is in good agreement with the previous<lb/> reports <ref type="biblio">[15,18]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>the three samples. Our results are somewhat different<lb/> from previous results on single crystals <ref type="biblio">[3,15]</ref>, but rather<lb/> resemble that of the thin film result <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. Notably, R H<lb/> around 250 K does not change with z, while the peak at<lb/> 110 K is clearly suppressed with increasing Zn concentra-<lb/>tion. Still, the behavior of cot θ H is in good agreement<lb/> with the previous studies; as is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, cot θ H<lb/> changes approximately as T 2 in a rather wide range, and<lb/> the Zn impurities add a T -independent offset which is<lb/> roughly proportional to z.<lb/> We note that the Zn-doping effect on R H (T ) ob-<lb/>served here is naturally expected in the context of the<lb/> two scattering time scenario. One can infer that the<lb/> primary effect of Zn-doping is to add some constant<lb/> impurity-scattering rates to both τ −1<lb/> tr and τ −1<lb/> H , because<lb/> both ρ ab (T ) and cot θ H (T ) show essentially parallel shifts<lb/> upon Zn-doping. Since one can approximately express<lb/> τ −1<lb/> tr ∼T and τ −1<lb/> H ∼T 2 in pure samples, the scattering rates<lb/> in Zn-doped samples can be approximated as τ −1<lb/> tr<lb/> ∼<lb/> T + A and τ −1<lb/> H<lb/> ∼ T 2 + B. From the relation R H H<lb/> = ρ ab / cot θ H ∼ τ H /τ tr , R H is approximately written as<lb/> R H ∼ (T + A)/(T 2 + B) in Zn-doped samples. If we<lb/> compare this expression with that for the pure samples,<lb/> R pure<lb/> H<lb/> ∼ T /T 2 ∼ T −1 , we can infer that at high temper-<lb/>atures R H in Zn-doped sample should approach R pure<lb/> H<lb/> ,<lb/> while at low temperatures R H in Zn-doped sample is ex-<lb/>pected to become smaller than R pure<lb/> H<lb/> (which can be eas-<lb/>ily seen when one considers T →0). The above heuristic<lb/> argument implies that the weakening of the T depen-<lb/>dence of R H (T ), combined with a z-independent room-<lb/>temperature R H , is a rather natural consequence of the<lb/> Zn-doping in the two scattering time scenario, although<lb/> this effect has not been well documented before.<lb/> Now let us analyze the data in more detail in regard of<lb/> the T dependence of cot θ H . A close examination of Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">3</ref> tells us that the data for z=0 and 0.006 are slightly<lb/> curved in this plot; we found that the best power laws to<lb/> describe the data in a wide temperature range are T 1.85 ,<lb/> T 1.9 , and T 2.0 , for z=0, 0.006, and 0.013, respectively.<lb/></p>

			<figure>0<lb/> 200<lb/> 400<lb/> 0<lb/> 40<lb/> 80 120 160 200 240 280<lb/> (cot<lb/> θ<lb/> H +28.4) / T 1.85<lb/> Temperature (K)<lb/> z=0<lb/> 0<lb/> 200<lb/> 400<lb/> (cot<lb/> θ<lb/> H -8.53) / T 1.90<lb/> z=0.006<lb/> 0<lb/> 200<lb/> 400<lb/> (cot<lb/> θ<lb/> H -53.8) / T 2.0<lb/> z=0.013<lb/> T 0<lb/> FIG. 4. Plots of (cot θH − C)/T α vs T , which emphasizes<lb/> where the the deviation from the high-temperature behavior<lb/> cot θH = C + DT α (with α≃2) takes place. The deviation at<lb/> T0 is marked by arrows.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, we show plots of (cot θ H − C)/T α vs T , which<lb/> cancels out the power-law temperature dependence and<lb/> therefore we can easily see the temperature range for the<lb/> T α dependence to hold well. Here, C is the offset value<lb/> (which increases with z) and α is the best power for each<lb/> Zn concentration. It is clear from Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> that the power-<lb/>law temperature dependence of cot θ H holds very well<lb/> down to a temperature T 0 (∼130 K) and then starts to<lb/> deviate in all the three samples. Incidentally, the devi-<lb/>ation occurs at a temperature very close to T g , which is<lb/> ∼130 K for y≈6.78 (Ref. <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>). This is a strong indication<lb/> that the change in cot θ H (T ) is caused by the opening of<lb/> the pseudogap <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. Our result shows that, unlike the Cu<lb/> NMR relaxation rate, the Zn-doping does not diminish or<lb/> shift the onset of the pseudogap marked by the change<lb/> in cot θ H at T 0 , at least up to the Zn concentration of<lb/> 1.3%. Note, however, that the deviation from the power<lb/> law becomes a bit weaker (or slower) with increasing z,<lb/> which is similar to what is seen in the behavior of ρ ab (T )<lb/> (inset to Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Given the fact that cot θ H is apparently affected by<lb/> the pseudogap below T 0 , it is useful to clarify how the<lb/> pseudogap effect is reflected in the T dependence of R H ,<lb/> which is a result of the two different T dependences <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref> of<lb/> the more fundamental parameters τ −1<lb/> tr and τ −1<lb/> H . For this<lb/> purpose, it is instructive to see how R H (T ) would behave<lb/> if cot θ H continues to change as T α down to T c . The inset<lb/> to Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the plots of the T dependence of such<lb/> hypothetical R hyp<lb/> H<lb/> for the three samples, where R hyp<lb/> H<lb/> is<lb/> calculated by dividing ρ ab by (C + DT α ) × H, where D<lb/> is the T -independent value at temperatures above T 0 in<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. It is clear from the behavior of R hyp<lb/> H that R H (T )<lb/> would not show a peak if cot θ H continues to change as<lb/> T α down to T c . Therefore, we can conclude that the peak<lb/> in R H (T ) in underdoped YBCO is caused by the opening<lb/> of the pseudogap.<lb/></p>

			<p>It should be noted that the direction of the change in<lb/> cot θ H at T 0 implies that τ −1<lb/> H is enhanced when the pseu-<lb/>dogap opens; this is opposite to the effect on τ −1<lb/> tr , which is<lb/> reduced below T * . Therefore, we cannot simply conclude<lb/> that the change in cot θ H is caused by a reduced electron-<lb/>electron scattering, which is the natural consequence of a<lb/> pseudogap in the low-energy electronic excitations. One<lb/> possibility to understand this apparently confusing fact is<lb/> to attribute the change at T 0 to the effective mass, rather<lb/> than to attribute it to the scattering rate; remember that<lb/> cot θ H = 1/(ω c τ H ) ∝ m H /τ H , where m H is the effective<lb/> mass of the particle responsible for the Hall channel <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>, so<lb/> an increase in cot θ H is expected when the effective mass<lb/> is enhanced. For example, if the pseudogap is related to<lb/> the formation of a dynamical charged stripes <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>, a mod-<lb/>ification in the FS topology, which leads to a change in<lb/> the effective mass, is expected. This picture is also con-<lb/>sistent with the observed robustness of the pseudogap<lb/> feature in cot θ H upon Zn doping, because the change in<lb/> the FS topology is rather insensitive to a small amount of<lb/> impurities. One might question why there is little trace<lb/> of the effective-mass change in the T dependence of ρ ab .<lb/> If cot θ H and ρ ab reflect different parts of the FS (as is<lb/> conjectured in the hot/cold spots scenario <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>), it is pos-<lb/>sible that the modification of the FS topology alters the<lb/> band mass for the Hall channel while leaving that of the<lb/> diagonal channel relatively unchanged.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, we note that the peak in the T dependence of<lb/> R H is not always caused by the pseudogap. For exam-<lb/>ple, in overdoped Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+δ (Tl-2201), it has been<lb/> reported <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref> that cot θ H shows a good T 2 dependence<lb/> down to near T c (which implies that the pseudogap does<lb/> not open), and yet the peak in R H (T ) is observed at<lb/> a temperature well above T c . In this case, the peak<lb/> in R H (T ) is just a result of the two different T depen-<lb/>dences of τ −1<lb/> tr ∼ T n + A (1≤n≤1.9) and τ −1<lb/> H ∼ T 2 + B<lb/> (note that in Tl-2201 both τ −1<lb/> tr and τ −1<lb/> H have somewhat<lb/> large offsets even in pure crystals <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>). Mathematically,<lb/> R H ∼ (T n + A)/(T 2 + B) has a peaked T -dependence<lb/> and thus R H (T ) can show a peak well above T c for some<lb/> combination of A and B, even when both ρ ab and cot θ H<lb/> do not show any deviation from the power laws. On the<lb/> other hand, as is demonstrated in the inset to Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>,<lb/> the peak in R H (T ) of underdoped YBCO cannot be ac-<lb/>counted for by the above origin and therefore is clearly<lb/> caused by the pseudogap. This argument tells us that<lb/> one should always look at the T dependence of cot θ H ,<lb/> not just the peak in R H (T ), to determine whether the<lb/> pseudogap is showing up through (ω c τ H ) −1 .<lb/></p>

			<p>In summary, we observed that cot θ H of pure and Zn-<lb/>doped YBCO (y=6.78) crystals shows an upward devia-<lb/>tion from the T 2 behavior below a temperature T 0 that is<lb/> notably higher than T c but is much lower than T * . The<lb/> onset temperature T 0 for this deviation, which is found to<lb/> be unaffected by Zn doping, is close to the lower temper-<lb/>ature scale for the pseudogap T g (probed by the Cu NMR<lb/> relaxation rate, for example). The fact that cot θ H tends<lb/> to be enhanced below T 0 suggests that the effect of the<lb/> pseudogap is not to reduce the Hall scattering rate; we<lb/> therefore propose that the effect is more likely to be origi-<lb/>nating from a change in the Fermi surface topology, which<lb/> causes a change in the effective mass. Also, we demon-<lb/>strated that the peak in R H (T ) of underdoped YBCO is<lb/> not just a result of two different scattering times, but is<lb/> actually a result of the pseudogap effect on cot θ H .</p>
