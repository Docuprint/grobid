			<p>The candidate type II Dirac semimetal PdTe 2 <ref type="biblio">[1-3]<lb/></ref> superconducts below 1.7 K <ref type="biblio">[4-8]</ref>. Though initial experi-<lb/>mental papers suggested the possibility of an unconven-<lb/>tional nature of the superconducting phase of PdTe 2 , a<lb/> number of experiments confirmed that the superconduc-<lb/>tivity in PdTe 2 is conventional in nature <ref type="biblio">[9, 10]</ref>. How-<lb/>ever, some of these experiments found evidence of type<lb/> I behaviour as far as the magnetic properties of the su-<lb/>perconducting phase of PdTe 2 are concerned <ref type="biblio">[4, 11, 12]</ref>.<lb/> These contradicted with certain other experiments where<lb/> the magnetic properties were found to be consistent with<lb/> type II superconductivity <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>. More recently, magnetic<lb/> field dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy exper-<lb/>iments revealed coexistence of type I and type II do-<lb/>mains in PdTe 2 where such an inhomogeneity of the su-<lb/>perconducting phase was attributed to electronic inho-<lb/>mogeneities observed in the normal state of PdTe 2 <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>.<lb/> It turned out that the electronic inhomogeneity could<lb/> alter the local electron density and the local coherence<lb/> length thereby leading to a distribution of the Ginzburg-<lb/>Landau-Abrikosov-Gorkov (GLAG) parameter (κ) over<lb/> the surface of PdTe 2 <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. Within this picture, it should<lb/> be possible to disorder the system so that inter-domain<lb/> scattering of the quasiparticles can average out the κ dis-<lb/>tribution and make the system homogeneous. In this pa-<lb/>per, we report the observation of such averaging effect<lb/> in Cu-PdTe 2 by magnetic field dependent scanning tun-<lb/>neling spectroscopy experiments. The superconducting<lb/> phase becomes homogeneously type II while the critical<lb/> temperature gets enhanced at randomly distributed do-<lb/>mains on the surface due to random distribution of the<lb/> intercalates .<lb/></p>

			<p>The effect of Cu-intercalation on the electrical and<lb/> thermal transport properties in PdTe 2 was investigated<lb/> in detail in the past <ref type="biblio">[16, 17]</ref>. Such measurements on<lb/> polycrystalline samples indicated that the higher T c in<lb/> Cu-PdTe 2 is due to enhanced electron-phonon coupling<lb/> parameter (λ ph ) and increased density of states upon Cu-<lb/>intercalation<ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. For the spectroscopic measurements<lb/> presented in this paper we used high quality single crys-<lb/>tals of Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 with 4% Cu in the crys-<lb/>tals. The shiny single crystals were first mounted in a<lb/> ultra-high vacuum (UHV) cleaving stage integrated with<lb/> the STM. The crystals were then cleaved at 80 K us-<lb/>ing a cleaver attached to an UHV manipulator. After<lb/> cleaving, the crystals were immediately transferred to<lb/> the STM head which is cooled down to 310 mK using<lb/> a H 3 -based cryostat. The sample is placed at the center<lb/> of a solenoidal superconducting magnet with a maximum<lb/> field strength of 11 Tesla. All the STM/S experiments re-<lb/>ported in this paper were performed with sharp metallic<lb/> tips of tungsten (W). The tips were fabricated by electro-<lb/>chemical etching and were cleaned by electron beam bom-<lb/>bardment under UHV in a preparation chamber attached<lb/> to the STM prior to the low temperature experiments.<lb/> The formation of the superconducting phase with T c =<lb/> 2.6 K is seen in the susceptibility versus temperature data<lb/> presented in Figure <ref type="figure">1(b)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Figure <ref type="figure">1(a)</ref>, we show an atomic resolution image<lb/> of the surface of Cu-PdTe 2 . A careful inspection of this<lb/> image reveals two types of defects -(i) triangular defects<lb/> as in PdTe 2 and typical for chalcogenides and (ii) dark<lb/> spots surrounded by well defined patterns. While (i) were<lb/> seen in non-intercalated PdTe 2 , (ii) are new and therefore<lb/> originate from the intercalated Cu atoms. Clear image<lb/> of the lattice captured from a defect-free region is shown<lb/> in the inset of Figure <ref type="figure">1(a)</ref>. The patterns formed around<lb/> the Cu atoms could be an interference pattern caused by<lb/> incoming quasiparticles and their counterparts scattered<lb/> from the Cu atoms. We have investigated the energy<lb/> dependence of such patterns in detail and found that the<lb/> pattern does not disperse with energy. Hence, the states<lb/> participating in formation of the patterns are most likely<lb/> topologically trivial surface states.<lb/></p>

			<p>The scanning tunnelling spectroscopy revealed two<lb/> types of spectra. One type captured at 310 mK is<lb/> shown as a blue line in Figure <ref type="figure">1(c)</ref>. The coherence<lb/> peaks are clearly seen below which the differential con-<lb/></p>

			<p>ductance becomes zero indicating formation of a full gap<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>, as expected for BCS superconductor. The spec-<lb/>trum is fitted using Dyne&apos;s equation given by N s (E) =<lb/> Re<lb/> (E−iΓ)<lb/> √<lb/> (E−iΓ) 2 −∆ 2 , where N s (E) is the density of states<lb/> at energy E, ∆ is the superconducting energy gap and, Γ<lb/> is an effective broadening parameter incorporated to take<lb/> care of slight broadening of the BCS density of states<lb/> possibly due to finite quasi-particle life time <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. For<lb/> the type of spectra shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1(c)</ref>, the extracted<lb/> value of ∆ is 0.53 meV. To note, the experimental spec-<lb/>tra slightly deviate from the theoretical fits just above<lb/> the coherence peaks -this deviation was not seen in case<lb/> of non intercalated PdTe 2 . As we will discuss later, this<lb/> type of spectra correspond to a higher T c ∼ 2.4 K. At<lb/> certain other points, the spectra are seen to be different<lb/> and their analysis reveal a smaller ∆ ∼ 0.44 meV. These<lb/> spectra also correspond to a lower T c ∼ 1.7 K. The de-<lb/>viation of the experimental data from the theoretical fits<lb/> are seen for these spectra as well. For the spectra with<lb/> smaller ∆, though the T c remains to be same as that of<lb/> pure PdTe 2 , the gap is measured to be higher than in<lb/> pure PdTe 2 (∼ 0.32 meV)<ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>. Hence, the the effect of<lb/> intercalation is present everywhere including the points<lb/> where a lower T c (and lower ∆) is measured.<lb/></p>

		<p>From a comparative consideration of the results dis-<lb/>cussed above, it appears that the superconducting phase<lb/> with higher T c that is expected to emerge upon Cu-<lb/>intercalation (as per bulk measurements) appears at sev-<lb/>eral places (as in figure <ref type="figure">1(c)</ref>) while, at several other<lb/> places, the enhancement of superconducting properties is<lb/> less (as in Figure <ref type="figure">1(d)</ref>). This suggests that the phase with<lb/> higher T c , though does not arise uniformly throughout<lb/> the crystals, exceeds the percolation threshold thereby<lb/> contributing predominantly in bulk transport measure-<lb/>ments. In order to search for a correlation between the<lb/> domains with higher T c phase and the defect states due<lb/> to Cu, we performed local spectroscopy near and away<lb/> from such defects. It was observed that the higher T c<lb/> phase appears more frequently in the Cu rich regions.<lb/></p>

			<p>One of the most intriguing features of the supercon-<lb/>ducting phase of PdTe 2 is that despite hosting topologi-<lb/>cally non-trivial bands crossing the Fermi surface<ref type="biblio">[21, 22]</ref>,<lb/> the superconducting order parameter is found to be con-<lb/>ventional and is seen to follow BCS-like temperature<lb/> dependence<ref type="biblio">[13, 23]</ref>. The conventional nature of the tem-<lb/>perature dependence is also found in case of the two en-<lb/>ergy gaps that are measured in Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 .<lb/> The temperature dependent spectra along with the the-<lb/>oretical fits are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2(a)</ref> for the phase with<lb/> higher ∆ and in Figure <ref type="figure">2(b)</ref> for the phase with lower ∆.<lb/> Surprisingly, in both the cases, while the lowest temper-<lb/>ature spectra showed no additional features other than<lb/> the sharp coherence peaks, at slightly elevated temper-<lb/>atures a small zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP) is<lb/> also seen to appear. When the emergence of the ZBCP<lb/> is considered along with the slight deviation of the ex-<lb/>perimental spectra from the theoretical fit, it is impor-<lb/>tant to first investigate whether a tiny unconventional<lb/> component in the order parameter can be present here.<lb/> Such a ZBCP may appear due to a small unconventional<lb/> component in the gap function that has a different tem-<lb/>perature dependence than the dominating conventional<lb/> component. In order to understand this point clearly,<lb/> let us consider a temperature dependent gap amplitude<lb/> given by ∆(T ) = α∆ s (T ) + β∆ un (T ), where ∆ s is the<lb/> conventional component and ∆ un is the unconventional<lb/> component of the gap, and α and β are the respective<lb/> coefficients. Now, since the ZBCP does not appear at<lb/> low temperatures, it is clear that at those temperatures,<lb/> α∆ s<lb/> β∆ un . Now, with increasing temperature, due<lb/> to the possible difference in temperature dependence of<lb/> ∆ s and ∆ un , at some point, the contribution of ∆ un<lb/> may become comparable to ∆ s thereby making the un-<lb/>conventional contribution detectable in the form of the<lb/> ZBCP. Beyond this temperature, as shown in the data,<lb/> all the spectroscopic features related to superconductiv-<lb/>ity get systematically reduced with a complete disappear-<lb/>ance of the spectral features at T c . It should be noted<lb/> that while the possibility of an unconventional compo-<lb/>nent cannot be ruled out, the ZBCP may also originate<lb/> from other sources, like inelastic impurity scattering with<lb/> non-trivial temperature dependence. Since no ZBCP is<lb/> seen in pure PdTe 2 , here, the enhanced scattering may be<lb/> due to the impurity states of the Cu intercalates. Since<lb/> the strength of the ZBCP is significantly smaller than<lb/> the overall spectra, we have fitted the temperature de-<lb/>pendent spectra ignoring the ZBCP. The temperature<lb/> dependent ∆ thus obtained, are plotted in Figure <ref type="figure">2(c)</ref><lb/> and Figure <ref type="figure">2(d)</ref> respectively for the larger ∆ and the<lb/> smaller ∆. The red dots represent the measured values<lb/> of ∆ and the solid lines show the expected temperature<lb/> dependence within BCS theory, barring a slight devia-<lb/>tion at higher temperatures. In both the cases, the tem-<lb/>perature evolution of the spectra is consistent with BCS<lb/> theory<ref type="biblio">[24]</ref>. From the measured valued of ∆ and T c , it is<lb/> seen that ∆/k B T c are ∼ 2.56 and 3.15 corresponding to<lb/> the larger ∆ and the smaller ∆ respectively. This means,<lb/> the regions where the effect of intercalation is smaller,<lb/> ∆/k B T c is higher. This shows that the elctron-phonon<lb/> coupling strength decreases upon Cu-intercalation. This<lb/> result apparently contradicts the theoretical finding of<lb/> an enhanced electron-phonon coupling constant (λ ph ) in<lb/> Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. Therefore, our results sug-<lb/>gest that the enhancement in T c in Cu-PdTe 2 is primarily<lb/> due to the enhanced density of states at the Fermi energy<lb/> and not due to altered electron-phonon coupling. How-<lb/>ever, these two processes may compete with each other<lb/> giving rise to an effective enhancement of superconduct-<lb/>ing properties in Cu-PdTe 2 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Now we focus on the magnetic field dependent spec-<lb/>troscopic measurements on Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 . As it<lb/> was discovered before, the surface of pure PdTe 2 hosts<lb/> co-existence of domains with type I and type II super-<lb/>conductivity. In the type I domains, the superconducting<lb/> spectra suddenly disappeared under the application of a<lb/> low magnetic field ∼ 250 Oe. In the type II regions, the<lb/> spectra survived up to much higher magnetic fields and<lb/> the spectral features were seen to disappear continuously.<lb/> Such variation of the type of superconductivity based<lb/> on magnetic properties could be attributed to inhomo-<lb/>geneity of local coherence length (ξ). An inhomogeneous<lb/> background possibly responsible for such inhomogeneity<lb/> in ξ was found in the normal state conductance maps.<lb/> Within this understanding, introduction of disorder into<lb/> the crystal is expected to reduce ξ everywhere.<lb/></p>

			<p>tunnelling conductance spectra captured at 310 mK at<lb/> three different points on the surface of Cu-PdTe 2 . In all<lb/> cases, the conductance spectra, regardless of the corre-<lb/>sponding superconducting energy gaps and T c , evolved<lb/> systematically and smoothly with magnetic field. The<lb/> spectral features continuously became less prominent<lb/> eventually disappearing at a critical field characteristic<lb/> for the point where the spectroscopic measurement was<lb/> performed. The critical fields measured in these cases are<lb/> 10 kG, 17 kG and 4.5 kG respectively. The ubiquitously<lb/> observed very low critical field (∼ 220 Oe) in PdTe 2 was<lb/> not detected on any point in Cu-PdTe 2 . It should be<lb/> noted that the measured critical fields at different points<lb/> is much larger than the expected &quot;surface critical field&quot;<lb/> (H s ∼ 1.7H c ) in BCS superconductors<ref type="biblio">[25-27]</ref>. Hence<lb/> the enhancement is not due to a naturally enhanced sur-<lb/>face critical field. In Figure <ref type="figure">3(c)</ref>, we also show Dyne&apos;s fit<lb/> of one set of the magnetic field dependent spectra and<lb/> the variation of the superconducting energy gap with in-<lb/>creasing magnetic field is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3(d)</ref>, where the<lb/> smooth disappearance of the gap is clearly visible. This<lb/> observation indicates that the superconductivity of Cu-<lb/>PdTe 2 has become uniformly of type II throughout the<lb/> crystal upon intercalation of Cu. This is different from<lb/> the mixed type I and type II superconducting phase that<lb/> was observed in pure PdTe 2 <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>.<lb/> The observation of the uniformly type II behaviour of<lb/> the superconducting phase upon Cu-intercalation sup-<lb/>ports the idea that the mixed type I and type II phase<lb/> in pure PdTe 2 originated from a distribution of the local<lb/> coherence length (ξ) and consequent distribution of κ.<lb/> Introduction of disorder in the lattice causes increased<lb/> scattering and a consequent decrease in the electronic<lb/> mean free path (l) leading to a decreased ξ following the<lb/> relation 1/ξ = 1/ξ 0 + 1/l, where ξ 0 is the BCS coher-<lb/>ence length in the absolute clean limit. When the local<lb/> ξ in the type I regions decrease, the GLAG parameter<lb/> (κ) also decreases and consequently these regions should<lb/> show magnetic properties of that of type II supercon-<lb/>ductors. The criteria for the transition from a type I<lb/> to a type II superconducting state in terms of the mean<lb/> free path (l) has been discussed elsewhere where it was<lb/> also shown that beyond a critical value of l, the super-<lb/>conducting phase is expected to become homogeneously<lb/> type II<ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another aspect of the magnetic field dependence of ∆<lb/> that needs attention is a sudden change in ∆ at H ∼<lb/> 100 Oe, where ∆ decreases to almost 50 % of the zero<lb/> field value. In a type II superconductor, such a sudden<lb/> change may be associated with the emergence of a su-<lb/>perconducting vortex in an area very close to the STM<lb/> tip thereby causing the suppression of local ∆. As shown<lb/> in the Γ vs. H plot in Figure <ref type="figure">3(d)</ref>, as ∆ shows a sud-<lb/>den drop, Γ shows a simultaneous upward jump (by a<lb/> factor of 6) at approximately the same magnetic field.<lb/> Γ represents pair breaking mechanisms leading to finite<lb/> quasiparticle lifetime. Hence, this observation is consis-<lb/>tent with the field-induced pair breaking under the STM<lb/> tip, possibly due to the emergence of a nearby vortex<lb/> core. However, despite our repeated attempts, we did<lb/> not find spectra with clear zero-bias conductance peak<lb/> in presence of magnetic field. To note, such zero-bias<lb/> peaks in presence of sufficiently large magnetic field were<lb/> frequently observed in pure PdTe 2 . It is possible that in<lb/> case of Cu-PdTe 2 , the nature of the vortex core spectrum<lb/> changes and becomes featureless and hence remains un-<lb/>detectable in our experiments. Beyond the field at which<lb/> the sudden change happens, both ∆ and Γ change grad-<lb/>ually and beyond a certain field Γ becomes larger than<lb/> ∆ thereby suppressing the key spectroscopic features.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, we have performed detailed scan-<lb/>ning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy on Cu-<lb/>intercalated crystals of PdTe 2 at different temperatures<lb/> and magnetic fields. The motivation was to address the<lb/> fate of the intriguing magnetic properties of PdTe 2 upon<lb/> Cu-intercalation. We found that Cu-intercalation en-<lb/>hances the critical temperature throughout the crystal<lb/> surface. In addition to T c enhancement, due to increased<lb/> disorder, the surface of Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 becomes<lb/> uniformly type II with no signature of co-existing type I<lb/> phase anywhere. The effective critical field at all points<lb/> becomes higher than that in the type I phase of pure<lb/> PdTe 2 . The results support the idea that the magnetic<lb/> properties and electronic structure in PdTe 2 surface are<lb/> highly correlated and the peculiar magnetic properties<lb/> reported before are a consequence of such correlation.<lb/></p>
