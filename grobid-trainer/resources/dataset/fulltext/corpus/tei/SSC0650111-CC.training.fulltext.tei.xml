			<p>An antiferromagnetic phase transition,<lb/> indicated by a maximum in the magnetic<lb/> susceptibility<lb/> (K) and anomalies in the<lb/> electrical<lb/> resistivity<lb/> (p), has been widely<lb/> observed in sintered powders and single crystals<lb/> of LR2CuO 4. Work by Johnston et al. and<lb/> Freltoft et al. <ref type="biblio">i</ref> on the variation of the Neel<lb/> temperature (TN) of La2Od04_ 6 as a function of 5<lb/> in sintered powders and crystals indicates that<lb/> T N approaches zero as 6 goes to zero.<lb/> More<lb/> recent experiments <ref type="biblio">2</ref> on single crystals of<lb/> La2Cu04_ ~ show the presence of strong 2D spin-<lb/>1/2 antiferromagnetic<lb/> fluctuations (quantum spin<lb/> fluid state) in the Cu-O planes above T N, with<lb/> three dimensional ordering setting in at<lb/> approximately 200 K in the crystal measured.<lb/></p>

		<p>Although the nature of the proposed 2]) quantum<lb/> state is not understood theoretically,<lb/> its<lb/> existence is not surprising given the huge<lb/> anisotropy observed <ref type="biblio">3</ref> in transport measurements<lb/> on single crystals of La2Cu04 that implies a<lb/> strongly 2D character in this material.<lb/></p>

			<p>To<lb/> provide further understanding of the highly<lb/> unusual physical properties of La2Cu04, we have<lb/> investigated the magnetic, transport and thermal<lb/> properties of single crystals in magnetic fields<lb/> applied in different directions with respect to<lb/> the Cu-O plane.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our samples were La2Cu04 crystals (~1 x 1 x<lb/> 0.1 cm 3) grown from a PbO-based flux.<lb/> Lattice<lb/> constants were determined by the eight-position<lb/> Hamilton technique 4 using ten reflections with<lb/> 29 ° &lt; e &lt; 37 ° . These x-ray measurements<lb/> indicated the orthorhombically distorted K2NiF4<lb/> structure at room temperatuge with lattice<lb/> constants a = 5.358 ± O.O02A, b = 13.181 ± 0.007<lb/> o<lb/> o<lb/> o<lb/> A and c = 5.403 ± 0.002 A (volume = 379.26 A3).<lb/></p>

			<p>Wet chemical analyses gave a composition of<lb/> Lat.vsCu04.3, plus ~2 at % Pb, for the crystals<lb/> studied.<lb/> The presence of Pb and excess oxygen<lb/> may be associated in part with PbO flux at the<lb/> sample surface; however, this cannot account for<lb/> all the oxygen excess.<lb/></p>

			<p>Resistance and magnetoresistance were<lb/> measured with a standard four probe technique<lb/> using In pressed contracts on the a-c basal<lb/> plane.<lb/></p>

			<p>In<lb/> contrast, the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the typical<lb/> resistance anomaly of single crystal La2Cu04_5<lb/> which orders antiferromagnetically<lb/> near 240 K.<lb/> All data shown here, except the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>,<lb/> are taken from single crystal samples which do<lb/> not indicate any ant•ferromagnetic<lb/> ordering-like<lb/> resistance anomaly in zero applied magnetic<lb/> field.<lb/></p>

			<p>The resistance drops rather<lb/> sharply at some magnetic field, suggesting the<lb/> presence of a field-induced phase transition.<lb/> (The notation &quot;phase transition&quot;<lb/> is used in the<lb/> sense of characterizing<lb/> the anomalies observed<lb/> as the temperature or magnetic field is varied.)<lb/> The resistance<lb/> drop is of the order of 10% at<lb/> 4 K and the effect diminishes as the temperature<lb/> is raised, becoming undetectable in our<lb/> measurements above 120 K. This leads to some<lb/> uncertainty<lb/> in determining the high temperature<lb/> portion of the magnetic field-temperature<lb/> phase<lb/> diagram shown in the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.<lb/> Hysteresis,<lb/> seen clearly in the 4 K-curve in<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, reduces rapidly as the temperature<lb/> increases and is unnoticeable above 20 K. We<lb/> note that conduction is highly anisotropic<lb/> in<lb/> these crystals.<lb/></p>

			<p>The anisotropy factor was<lb/> determined by the Montgomery method <ref type="biblio">s</ref> in several<lb/> specimens.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although slight variations<lb/> from<lb/> sample to sample were found, typical values for<lb/> the anisotropy are &gt;150 (&gt;250) at room tempera-<lb/>ture (liquid nitrogen temperature), with the<lb/> lower resistivity<lb/> in the Cu-O plane.<lb/> Such a<lb/> huge anisotropy in the electrical<lb/> resistivity<lb/> clearly demonstrates that La2Cu04 is electroni-<lb/>cally two-dimensional.<lb/></p>

			<p>Futhermore, the CU-O<lb/> plane has a metallic-like<lb/> temperature dependent<lb/> resistivity<lb/> above ~130 K but is semiconductor-<lb/>like at lower temperatures; however,<lb/> conductivity perpendicular<lb/> to the Cu-O plane is<lb/> semiconductor-like<lb/> for all T &lt; 300 K.<lb/></p>

			<p>[Below ~170 K, the susceptibility<lb/> measured in a<lb/> 4 T field can be fit to Kmole = ~o + C/(T + e),<lb/> where Ko = 8.2 x 10 -~ emu/mole Cu, C = 5.3 x<lb/> 10 -° emu-K/mole Cu, and e = 37.5 K, implying an<lb/> effective moment of 0.21 y.D/Cu i£ the Curie term<lb/> is due solely to Cu.] The utemperatures at which<lb/> the peak appears in various fields agree with<lb/> the phase boundary shown in the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>,<lb/> additionally<lb/> supporting the presence of a phase<lb/> transition.<lb/></p>

			<p>The magnetization as a function of<lb/> applied magnetic field perpendicular to the<lb/> basal plane at 20 K is displayed in the inset of<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, where a slope change can be seen clearly<lb/> near 3 T.<lb/></p>

			<p>The jump in magnetization at 3 T and<lb/> 20 K, defined by the construction shown in the<lb/> inset, is ~5,9 x 10 -4 emu, which implies an<lb/> increase of 1.25 x 10 -4 pB/formula unit.<lb/> We<lb/> note that the magnetization curve as a function<lb/> of magnetic field taken at 2 K shows a large<lb/> hysteresis<lb/> which by 20 K becomes smaller than<lb/> the experimental resolution.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is interesting<lb/> that magnetization vs. magnetic field applied in<lb/> the basal plane at various fixed temperatures<lb/> does not show a similar jump within the<lb/> sensitivity<lb/> in our measurement.<lb/> We also note<lb/> that for 4 K &lt; T &lt; 350 K the magnetic<lb/> susceptibility<lb/> measured with H in the basal<lb/> plane is nearly three times smaller than that<lb/> with the magnetic field perpendicular<lb/> to the<lb/> basal plane.<lb/></p>

			<p>Specific heat (C) measurements also were<lb/> performed on two of these crystals<lb/> {total mass<lb/> 39.38 mg) and the results are plotted as C/T vs.<lb/> T 2 in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>the linear term in the specific heat also<lb/> appears to be intrinsic,<lb/> being observed in<lb/> different<lb/> single crystals as well as in<lb/> polycrystalline<lb/> samples of La2CuO 4.<lb/></p>

			<p>We believe there is substantial<lb/> indirect<lb/> evidence that the phase transition<lb/> we observe is<lb/> not o£ conventional origin and is a bulk<lb/> property of La2CuO 4 crystals which do not order<lb/> three-dimensionally.<lb/></p>

			<p>(1)<lb/> The extreme sensiti-<lb/>vity of the transition<lb/> temperature to applied<lb/> magnetic fields is to be contrasted with<lb/> observations ~° on the Neel temperature of oxygen<lb/> deficient<lb/> polycrystalline<lb/> samples in which 4.5 T<lb/> suppresses T N by only ~10%.<lb/></p>

			<p>We find a similar<lb/> field dependence of T N in oxygen deficient<lb/></p>

				<figure>Fig. 4.<lb/> Specific heat divided by temperature<lb/> vs. temperature squared (C/T vs. T 2)<lb/> from 1.8 K to 20 K. As shown in the<lb/> inset, an extrapolated value for the<lb/> linear term in the specific heat is 1<lb/> mJ/mole K 2 and the Debye 8 D is 320 K.<lb/></figure>

			<p>extrapolation<lb/> of the data to T = 0 gives a<lb/> finite<lb/> intercept of 1.0 ± 0.1 mJ/mole Cu K2, <ref type="biblio">7,e</ref><lb/> which is unchanged in a 10 T magnetic field,<lb/> suggesting that the finite value of C/T at T = 0<lb/> may not be related to the phase transition.<lb/> Normalized per unit volume, the result ~ = 8.8<lb/> J/m3K 2 is smaller than metallic copper by one<lb/> order o£ magnitude but several times larger than<lb/> typical structural<lb/> glasses, e.g. vitreous<lb/> silica.<lb/></p>

			<p>The low temperature upturn in C/T may<lb/> si~l<lb/> the onset o£ a nuclear Schottky anomaly;<lb/> although, an alternative<lb/> explanation has been<lb/> proposed 9 that attributes<lb/> this behavior to the<lb/> presence of a hyperfine magnetic field at the Cu<lb/> nucleus produced by itinerant<lb/> antiferromagnetic<lb/> order in the Cu-O planes.<lb/></p>

			<p>We emphasize that our experimental findings<lb/> are not limited to one crystal but are highly<lb/> reproducible:<lb/> the response of the magnetic<lb/> susceptibility<lb/> and resistance<lb/> to temperature and<lb/> magnetic field reported here has been observed<lb/> in several crystals<lb/> from the same preparation<lb/> batch.<lb/></p>

			<p>I~gnetoresistance<lb/> measurements on<lb/> La2Cu04 crystals prepared in a different<lb/> batch,<lb/> but using the same growth procedure, also show a<lb/> phase transition<lb/> at similar fields and tempera-<lb/>tures.<lb/></p>

			<p>Furthermore, the transition<lb/> was affected<lb/> only weakly by doping crystals with Zn impuri-<lb/>ties and by removing small amounts of oxygen via<lb/> vacuum annealing with a Zr getter.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the<lb/> latter case, still<lb/> no evidence for 3D antiferro-<lb/>magnetic order was found but the magneto-<lb/>resistance anomaly at 4 K was less pronounced.<lb/> Analysis of resistivity<lb/> data on these other<lb/> crystals<lb/> results<lb/> in H-T phase diagrams similar<lb/> to the one in the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.<lb/> Likewise.<lb/></p>

			<p>single crystals;<lb/> (2) The temperature dependence<lb/> of the phase transition<lb/> field is opposite that<lb/> expected for a conventional spin-flop<lb/> transition;<lb/></p>

			<p>(3) The &quot;universality&quot;<lb/> of results<lb/> obtained on several different<lb/> single crystals<lb/> argues against impurities or defects causing the<lb/> phase transition;<lb/></p>

			<p>and (4) Rather large changes<lb/> in the resistivity<lb/> and magnetization at the<lb/> transition<lb/> surest<lb/> that it is a bulk effect.<lb/> In the absence o£ detailed microscopic<lb/> measurements, it is difficult<lb/> to specify the<lb/> nature of the phase diagram we have observed.<lb/> As discussed earlier by others, 2 the small<lb/> susceptibility<lb/> for a system such as La2CuO 4 with<lb/> a large concentration of S = 1/2 spins suggests<lb/> the presence of strong antiferromagnetic<lb/> fluctuations<lb/> at room temperature or below.<lb/> The<lb/> absence o£ a well-defined<lb/> (i.e.,<lb/> sharp in field<lb/> and temperature) phase transition<lb/> may be due to<lb/> either low dimensionality effects,<lb/> deviation<lb/> from perfect stoichiometry,<lb/> quantum fluctua-<lb/>tions, or frustrations<lb/> arising from nearest and<lb/> next-nearest<lb/> neighbor interactions.<lb/> Low<lb/> dimensionality has been invoked tl to account for<lb/> the relatively<lb/> low 3D antiferromagnetic<lb/> ordering<lb/> temperature in oxygen deficient<lb/> specimens.<lb/> Our<lb/> observations,<lb/> if related to 3D ordering, are of<lb/> a distinctly<lb/> different<lb/> nature because:<lb/></p>

			<p>(1) a<lb/> magnetic field suppresses the transition<lb/> temperature much more rapidly than it does T N in<lb/> oxygen deficient<lb/> samples and (2) the transition<lb/> is insensitive<lb/> to partial<lb/> removal of oxygen.<lb/> An<lb/> attractive<lb/> alternative<lb/> is the possibility<lb/> of an<lb/> unusual transition<lb/> not involving 3D order, as<lb/> could be envisioned for a system with aniso-<lb/>tropic magnetic interactions<lb/> sufficiently<lb/> weak<lb/> that it could not be described within the<lb/> framework of either 2D Ising or Heisenberg<lb/> models.<lb/></p>

			<p>Frustration<lb/> effects,<lb/> common to the<lb/> resonating valence bond model of Anderson, t2<lb/> also are distinctly<lb/> possible explanations for<lb/> the observed phase transition.<lb/></p>

			<p>Some of these<lb/> questions may be resolved by additional<lb/> experiments on single crystals<lb/> in which both<lb/> metal atoms and oxygen content are varied<lb/> systematically.</p>
