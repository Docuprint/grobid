		<p>The in-plane thermal conductivity (κ ab ) of cuprate<lb/> superconductors has been studied extensively over the<lb/> past several years. <ref type="biblio">1</ref> Unresolved issues remain concern-<lb/>ing the normal-state temperature dependence and the<lb/> superconducting-state enhancement. Because of the low<lb/> carrier density, heat conduction by the lattice accounts<lb/> for more than half of the measured normal-state κ ab in<lb/> these materials. One would expect κ ab (T ) in high-quality<lb/> crystals to reflect a dominant lattice contribution simi-<lb/>lar to that of crystalline insulators, i.e. κ ab ∼ 1/T at<lb/> high-T , rising sharply to a maximum at low T . This be-<lb/>havior is observed in Nd 2−x Ce x CuO 4 (Nd-214), <ref type="biblio">2</ref> but for<lb/> all other cuprates investigated κ ab is very weakly T de-<lb/>pendent for T &gt; T c . Whereas for Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCuO 8 struc-<lb/>tural disorder (e.g., the Bi-O layer modulation <ref type="biblio">3</ref> ) might<lb/> explain its nearly glass-like lattice contribution, <ref type="biblio">4</ref> this<lb/> would not seem applicable to YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+x (Y-123) and<lb/> La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (La-214). Furthermore, κ ab (T ) for un-<lb/>doped, insulating Y-123 and La-214 is unconventional, <ref type="biblio">5<lb/></ref> suggesting that the weak T -dependence of κ ab is generic<lb/> to the latter materials and not directly related to<lb/> the presence of free charge. An unidentified phonon<lb/> damping mechanism appears to underlie this behavior,<lb/> possibly due to local lattice distortions <ref type="biblio">5</ref> and/or mag-<lb/>netic excitations. <ref type="biblio">6</ref> Regarding the enhancement, <ref type="biblio">4,7</ref> ther-<lb/>mal Hall conductivity experiments <ref type="biblio">8</ref> on optimally-doped<lb/> Y-123 imply that the phenomenon is largely electronic in<lb/> origin, but less is known about underdoped compounds.<lb/> The magnitude of the enhancement correlates with the<lb/> superconducting pair density <ref type="biblio">9,10</ref> in Y-123 throughout<lb/> the underdoped regime, and it is of interest to explore<lb/> the generality of this behavior through studies of other<lb/> cuprates.<lb/></p>

			<p>Here we report measurements of the in-plane thermal<lb/> conductivity of YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 (Y-124). This material is of<lb/> particular interest with regard to the issues mentioned<lb/> above because of its structural similarity to Y-123, ab-<lb/>sence of oxygen vacancies on the CuO chains, and the<lb/> naturally underdoped state of the CuO 2 planes. We find<lb/> that the magnitude of κ a (transverse to the chains) at<lb/> T =300K is comparable to that of Y-123, but κ b is 3-<lb/>4 times larger. A very large in-plane anisotropy in the<lb/> lattice conduction is implied. Both κ a (T ) and κ b (T ) be-<lb/>have as in conventional crystalline insulators (like Nd-<lb/>214); their maximum values (at T ≃ 20K) are the highest<lb/> reported for any cuprate and exceed those of Y-123 by an<lb/> order of magnitude. These results imply a strong damp-<lb/>ing of phonons by static or dynamic structural distortions<lb/> as the source for the much weaker T dependence of κ ab<lb/> in Y-123. The superconducting-state enhancement for<lb/> Y-124 is comparable in magnitude to that of T c =60K Y-<lb/>123, consistent with the underdoped state of the planes in<lb/> the double-chain compound. We discuss the anisotropy<lb/> of the enhancement and its implications for the Lorenz<lb/> number.<lb/></p>

		<p>Thermal conductivity measurements were performed<lb/> on three single crystals grown by a high-pressure flux<lb/> method as described previously. <ref type="biblio">11</ref> Two of these (189 and<lb/> 259) were grown in Al 2 O 3 crucibles yielding a slight Al<lb/> contamination, and T c = 72K. Recent analyses indicate <ref type="biblio">12<lb/></ref> that Al substitutes for 1-2% of the Cu(2) atoms in the<lb/> CuO 2 planes. As we discuss below, this light doping has a<lb/> substantial effect on the thermal conductivity. The third<lb/> crystal (315), grown in Y 2 O 3 and without Al contami-<lb/>nation, had T c = 80K. Typical crystal dimensions were<lb/> 0.8 × 0.5 × 0.05mm 3 , with the shortest dimension along<lb/> the crystalline c axis. The a-and b-axis electrical resis-<lb/>tivities of similarly-prepared crystals have been discussed<lb/> extensively elsewhere; <ref type="biblio">13</ref> typical values at T =300K are<lb/> ρ a = 400µΩcm and ρ b = 130µΩcm. The steady-state<lb/> thermal conductivity measurements employed a fine-wire<lb/> differential chromel-constantan thermocouple and minia-<lb/>ture chip resistor as heater, both glued to the specimen<lb/> with varnish or epoxy. The absolute accuracy of the mea-<lb/>surements is ±20% due to uncertainty in the placement<lb/> of the thermocouple junctions. No corrections for heat<lb/> losses (via radiation and conduction through the leads)<lb/> have been applied; these are estimated to be ∼ 10%<lb/> near room temperature and &lt;<lb/> ∼ 2% at T &lt;<lb/> ∼ 120K. For<lb/> specimens 259 and 315 gold contacts were vapor de-<lb/>posited and their a-axis thermoelectric powers measured,<lb/> yielding S(290K) = 36µV/K and 16µV/K, respectively.<lb/> These values provide estimates of the hole concentration<lb/> per planar Cu atom, <ref type="biblio">14</ref> p ≃ 0.09 and 0.11 for the Al-doped<lb/> and undoped specimens, respectively.<lb/></p>

		<p>The results for κ a and κ b are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.<lb/> The anisotropy in the normal state is substantial, with<lb/> κ b /κ a ∼ 3−4 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The normal-state T dependence in<lb/> both crystallographic directions is close to 1/T for spec-<lb/>imen 315 and is significantly weaker (∼ 1/T 1/2 ) for the<lb/> crystals containing Al. In all cases the T -dependence is<lb/> substantially stronger than that of both T c = 92K and<lb/> 60K Y-123 (solid lines, Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). At low T the character-<lb/>istic dielectric maxima are observed near 20K. A change<lb/> in slope is evident at T c [Fig. <ref type="figure">3 (a)</ref>] for all specimens,<lb/> though not appearing as prominent as in Y-123 because<lb/> of the substantially stronger normal-state T dependence.<lb/> The low-T maximum values, κ b ≃ 140 and 245 W/mK<lb/> for samples 189 and 259, respectively (and 500W/mK for<lb/> crystal 315 by extrapolation), are the largest reported for<lb/> any cuprate, exceeding the 100W/mK of insulating Nd-<lb/>214, <ref type="biblio">2</ref> and 25-40 W/mK observed in untwinned T c = 92K<lb/> Y-123. <ref type="biblio">15,16,17,18,19</ref> These observations indicate substan-<lb/>tially superior and rather conventional lattice conduction<lb/> in Y-124, confirming a similar conclusion based on pre-<lb/>vious measurements of polycrystals.</p>

			<p>The total thermal conductivity is a sum of elec-<lb/>tronic and lattice components, κ = κ e + κ L . First<lb/> let us consider the electronic contributions, κ a,e and<lb/> κ b,e . The Wiedemann-Franz law, κ e (T ) = L 0 T /ρ (L 0 =<lb/> 2.44 × 10 −8 WΩ/K 2 ), and electrical resistivities <ref type="biblio">13</ref> pro-<lb/>vide upper-bound estimates: κ e,a (300K) ≈ 2W/mK and<lb/> κ e,b (300K) ≈ 6W/mK. These imply κ L,a ≈ 8W/mK and<lb/> κ L,b ≈ 25 − 39W/mK, and the very large in-plane lat-<lb/>tice anisotropy, κ L,b /κ L,a ∼ 3 − 4. This is to be con-<lb/>trasted with Y-123 where similar analyses suggest that<lb/> κ L is nearly isotropic in the planes. <ref type="biblio">16,17,18,19</ref> Since Y-124<lb/> and Y-123 differ only in their CuO-chain structures, we<lb/> must conclude that the strong lattice anisotropy in Y-124<lb/> is directly connected with the chain-related vibrational<lb/> spectrum.<lb/></p>

			<p>Anisotropy in κ L can arise from either anisotropy of<lb/> the phonon group velocities, their relaxation times, or<lb/> both. Though optic modes can contribute to heat trans-<lb/>port and the anisotropy, their contribution should dimin-<lb/>ish with decreasing temperature as should any associ-<lb/>ated anisotropy. <ref type="biblio">21</ref> This is contrary to our observation<lb/> that κ b /κ a in the normal-state is nearly constant or in-<lb/>creases with decreasing T (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) [the decrease in κ b /κ a<lb/> below T c is related to superconductivity, as discussed be-<lb/>low]. Experimental dispersion curves are not available for<lb/> Y-124, however the computed spectrum <ref type="biblio">22</ref> is quite simi-<lb/>lar to that of Y-123, and does not imply a substantial<lb/> in-plane anisotropy in the acoustic-mode group veloci-<lb/>ties. These observations would suggest a large anisotropy<lb/> in the phonon relaxation rates in Y-124, but further in-<lb/>formation about the low-energy vibrational spectrum is<lb/> clearly needed to address this issue.<lb/></p>

			<p>The rather strong influence of the light Al doping in<lb/> the planes on κ provides insight into the phonon scat-<lb/>tering in both Y-124 and Y-123. Nuclear quadrupole <ref type="biblio">12<lb/></ref></p>

			<p>resonance studies of similar Y-124 crystalsreveal substan-<lb/>tially larger <ref type="biblio">63</ref> Cu linewidths in the Al-doped crystals,<lb/> attributed to static disorder in the Cu(2)-apical oxygen<lb/> bondlengths (a typical Al-O bondlength for octahedral<lb/> coordination is 1.94Å as compared with 2.28Å for Cu-<lb/>O). Such local structural distortions evidently represent<lb/> a much more effective phonon scattering mechanism than<lb/> does the mass defect <ref type="biblio">23,24</ref> introduced by the substitution.<lb/> The local structural modifications may also explain why<lb/> the hole concentration and T c are so dramatically sup-<lb/>pressed -the 2% Al substitution for planar Cu reduces<lb/> the mobile planar hole concentration by about 20%, i.e.<lb/> a ten-fold larger reduction than would be expected if<lb/> each Al atom filled one hole. This observation suggests<lb/> that the suppression of mobile holes, by the combined<lb/> effects of charge compensation, disorder-induced local-<lb/>ization, and changes in the local electronic structure, ex-<lb/>tends to next nearest neighbors of each Al atom in the<lb/> planes.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Y-123 a similar static disorder in the apical<lb/> bondlengths is induced by oxygen vacancies on the<lb/> chains <ref type="biblio">25</ref> and there is evidence for static or dynamical<lb/> structural distortions of the CuO 2 planes in the normal<lb/> state, <ref type="biblio">26</ref> possibly related to oxygen vacancies or diffusion<lb/> that are absent in Y-124. The implication is that these<lb/> features give rise to substantial damping of in-plane heat-<lb/>carrying phonons, and are the origin of the weaker T -<lb/>dependence and in-plane anisotropy observed for κ in the<lb/> single-chain compound.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is of interest to compare the superconducting-state<lb/> enhancement of κ for Y-124 with that of Y-123. <ref type="biblio">9,10</ref> We<lb/> define the enhancement as 10 Γ ≡ −d(κ s /κ n )/dt| t→1 , the<lb/> reduced temperature derivative of the superconducting<lb/> to normal-state thermal conductivity ratio near T c . κ n is<lb/> determined by a polynomial extrapolation of the normal-<lb/>state data just below T c as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3 (a)</ref>. Fig-<lb/>ure <ref type="figure">3 (b)</ref> shows the normalized data and corresponding<lb/> slopes.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Γ values agree with those found for twinned Y-<lb/>123 at similar p values, <ref type="biblio">10</ref> indicating that for the regime<lb/> investigated here (p ≤ 0.11), Γ is largely determined by<lb/> the change in scattering that occurs in the CuO 2 planes.<lb/> That Γ a is larger for Al-free specimen 315 than for spec-<lb/>imen 259 is consistent with the higher mobile hole con-<lb/>centration in the planes of the former. Also of interest is<lb/> the anisotropy: Γ a /Γ b ≈ 1.5 for specimen 259. Evidently<lb/> this anisotropy is responsible for the decrease in κ b /κ a at<lb/> T ≤ T c (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). A similar behavior was observed for un-<lb/>twinned Y-123 (x ∼ 0.9) [solid and dashed lines in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>],<lb/> where the enhancement is also anisotropic, <ref type="biblio">16,17,18,19</ref> with<lb/> a slightly smaller Γ a /Γ b ≈ 1.2 − 1.5.<lb/></p>

			<p>Consider Γ in more detail. We may write,<lb/></p>

				<formula>Γ i = (κ e,i /κ i )Γ e,i + (κ L,i /κ i )Γ L,i ,<lb/></formula>

				<label>(1)<lb/></label>

		<p>where i = a, b, and Γ e,i and Γ L,i are the i-axis electronic<lb/> and lattice slope changes, respectively. The thermal con-<lb/>ductivities are evaluated at T c . Theoretically <ref type="biblio">27</ref> Γ e is a<lb/></p>

		<p>sum of two terms: one proportional to d∆ 2 /dt| t=1 and<lb/> the other proportional to −d(τ s<lb/> qp /τ n<lb/> qp )/dt| t=1 (∆ and τ qp<lb/> are the real part of the superconducting gap and quasi-<lb/>particle (qp) lifetime, respectively). In the cuprates, the<lb/> second term predominates due to the strong suppression<lb/> of qp scattering <ref type="biblio">28</ref> at T &lt; T c , and Γ e is positive. Scat-<lb/>tering of phonons by charge carriers always produces a<lb/> positive lattice term (Γ L ), but the thermal Hall conduc-<lb/>tivity measurements of Krishana et al. <ref type="biblio">8</ref> indicate that the<lb/> electronic contribution to the enhancement predominates<lb/> in optimally-doped Y-123. Their data for twinned Y-<lb/>123 (x ∼ 0.9) yields: Γ ab ≃ 1.4, Γ e,ab ≃ 12.5, and<lb/> κ e,ab /κ ab ≃ 9 × 10 −2 . Thus, Γ L,ab ≃ 0.3, and about<lb/> 80% of the slope change for optimally-doped Y-123 is<lb/> electronic in origin. Recent measurements <ref type="biblio">29</ref> suggest that<lb/> the slope change in underdoped Y-123 is also largely elec-<lb/>tronic in origin, and thus it is likely that this conclusion<lb/> also applies to Y-124.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given these observations, one might expect that the Γ<lb/> anisotropy simply follows that of the superfluid, with the<lb/> larger qp lifetime enhancement occurring for transport<lb/> along the crystallographic direction characterized by the<lb/> largest superfluid density. However, this is not the case;<lb/> for Y-123 and Y-124 the superfluid density is 2-3 times<lb/> larger along the chains, <ref type="biblio">30,31,32</ref> whereas Γ is larger along<lb/> the planes. To get further insight into the origin of the<lb/> Γ anisotropy, we examine the limiting case, Γ L,i = 0, for<lb/> which Γ i is determined entirely by the electronic term.<lb/> The electronic superconducting-state slope change may<lb/> be related to the low-frequency electrical conductivity<lb/> via the Wiedemann-Franz law, <ref type="biblio">33</ref> κ e,i = L i σ 1i T , where L i<lb/> and σ 1i are the Lorenz number and real part of the elec-<lb/>trical conductivity, respectively. Substituting into Eq. <ref type="formula">1<lb/></ref> we have<lb/></p>

				<formula>Γ i = −<lb/> L i σ 1i T 2<lb/> c<lb/> κ i<lb/> 1<lb/> L i<lb/> dL s<lb/> i<lb/> dT<lb/> −<lb/> dL n<lb/> i<lb/> dT<lb/> +<lb/> 1<lb/> σ 1 i<lb/> dσ s<lb/> 1i<lb/> dT<lb/> −<lb/> dσ n<lb/> 1i<lb/> dT<lb/> T =Tc<lb/></formula>

				<label>(2)<lb/></label>

		<p>Theoretically, the first term has magnitude and sign that<lb/> are highly model dependent. <ref type="biblio">34</ref> We first examine the sec-<lb/>ond term. For untwinned, optimally-doped Y-123, the<lb/> microwave data of Zhang et al. <ref type="biblio">30</ref> yield, (dσ s<lb/> 1a /dT )| Tc ≃<lb/> −0.8 × 10 5 (Ω m K) −1 and (dσ s<lb/> 1b /dT )| Tc ≃ −1.8 × 10 5 (Ω<lb/> m K) −1 . For the normal-state data we employ dσ/dT =<lb/> −(1/ρ 2 )dρ/dT and an average of ρ(T ) measurements<lb/> on high-quality untwinned crystals <ref type="biblio">35</ref> : ρ a (T c ) ≃ 75 ±<lb/> 25µΩcm, dρ a /dT | Tc ≃ 0.85 ± 0.25µΩcm/K, ρ b (T c ) ≃<lb/> 38 ± 12µΩcm, dρ b /dT | Tc ≃ 0.35 ± 0.10µΩcm/K. For the<lb/> κ data we use, 17 κ a (T c ) = 11.5W/mK and κ b (T c ) =<lb/> 16.0W/mK. With these values, the second terms in the<lb/> expressions for Γ a and Γ b are, (1.2 ± 0.2)L a /L 0 and<lb/> (2.0 ± 0.2)L b /L 0 , respectively. Experiments <ref type="biblio">16,17,18,19</ref> in-<lb/>dicate Γ a = 1.5 − 1.6 and Γ b = 1.0 − 1.3. One possibility<lb/> is that the first terms, (dL s<lb/> i /dT − dL n<lb/> i /dT )| Tc , are negli-<lb/>gible, whence the Lorenz numbers at T c are L a /L 0 ≃ 1.3<lb/> and L b /L 0 ≃ 0.6. Though L n &gt; L 0 has been predicted<lb/> for strongly correlated systems, <ref type="biblio">36</ref> these values for L a and<lb/> L b are incompatible with the results of Ref. <ref type="biblio">8</ref> which im-<lb/>ply L ab ∼ (0.3 − 0.5)L 0 for twinned crystals. The lat-<lb/>ter estimate is consistent with the theoretical analysis<lb/> of Hirschfeld and Putikka, <ref type="biblio">7</ref> which incorporates inelastic<lb/> spin-fluctuation scattering and parameters constrained to<lb/> fit the normal-state NMR relaxation and electrical resis-<lb/>tivity. We thus conclude that both L a and L b are less<lb/> than L 0 and that the (dL s<lb/> i /dT − dL n<lb/> i /dT )| Tc are nega-<lb/>tive and of comparable magnitude to the second terms<lb/> in Eq. <ref type="formula">2</ref>. A considerable a/b anisotropy (∼ 2 − 3) in<lb/> the L i , (dL s<lb/> i /dT − dL n<lb/> i /dT )| Tc , or both is then implied.<lb/> Calculations which incorporate inelastic as well as elastic<lb/> scattering to yield the L i (T ) near T c would be useful to<lb/> extract further information from the Γ i .</p>
