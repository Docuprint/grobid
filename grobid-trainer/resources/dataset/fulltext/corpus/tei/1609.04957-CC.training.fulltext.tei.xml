		<p>The phase diagram of the electron-doped high-<lb/>transition-temperature<lb/> (T c )<lb/> iron-based<lb/> pnictide<lb/> LaFeAsO 1−x H x (H-doped La1111 series) is unique<lb/> owing to the capability of electron doping: (i) It<lb/> exhibits a superconducting (SC) phase with double<lb/> domes covering a wide H-doping range from x = 0.05<lb/> to x = 0.44 <ref type="biblio">1</ref> , (ii) the SC phase is sandwiched by<lb/> antiferromagnetic (AF) phases appearing in heavily and<lb/> poorly electron-doped regimes [see Fig. <ref type="figure">1(a)</ref>] <ref type="biblio">2</ref> , and (iii)<lb/> the application of pressure transforms the double domes<lb/> into a single dome <ref type="biblio">1,3</ref> . Intriguingly, upon applying<lb/> pressure, the minimum T c at ambient pressure becomes<lb/> the maximum T c of over 45 K <ref type="biblio">1</ref> , as shown by the solid<lb/> arrow in Figs. <ref type="figure">1(a)</ref> and <ref type="biblio">4</ref> as described in detail below.<lb/> The unique features established in this compound have<lb/></p>

			<p>not been observed so far in other iron-based pnictides,<lb/> such as the Ba122 and Na111 series, which have been in-<lb/>vestigated intensively from an early stage because they<lb/> are available as large crystals. The electronic phase di-<lb/>agram of the Ba122 series is similar to that of high-T c<lb/> cuprates <ref type="biblio">4</ref> . The analogy is reminiscent of the impor-<lb/>tance of AF fluctuations in iron-based pnictides. The<lb/> spin-fluctuation-mediated mechanism is a major candi-<lb/>date for the high-T c mechanism. In fact, the SC phase<lb/> of the Ba122 series partially overlaps the AF phase, in<lb/> other words, the SC and AF states are compatible, and<lb/> the maximum T c occurs close to the phase boundary [see<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">1(b)</ref>] <ref type="biblio">5,6</ref> . Because of this special location, T c is en-<lb/>hanced and low-energy AF fluctuations simultaneously<lb/> become predominant as the doping level approaches the<lb/> AF phase <ref type="biblio">7,8</ref> . The Na111 series has a phase diagram sim-<lb/>ilar to that of the Ba122 series; however, the SC phase<lb/> overlaps the AF phase over a wide doping range and even<lb/> extends to the undoped material <ref type="biblio">9</ref> . By tuning pressure,<lb/> T c and AF fluctuations are found to be related in a similar<lb/> manner as in the Ba122 series <ref type="biblio">10</ref> . A pressure-enhanced<lb/> T c occurs in the 11 series FeSe, which is superconducting<lb/> and has no magnetic orders at ambient pressure. At first<lb/> sight, the series seems to be free from the antiferromag-<lb/>netism; however, at pressures exceeding 1 GPa, the SC<lb/> phase is adjacent to the AF or AF+SC phase <ref type="biblio">11</ref> . In fact,<lb/> the influence of AF fluctuations is observable in the SC<lb/> phase even at ambient pressure <ref type="biblio">12</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>AF fluctuations seem to play a key role in raising T c for<lb/> various iron-based pnictides; however, the scenario does<lb/> not work well for LaFeAsO 1−x F x , because for x = 0.14,<lb/> T c increases up to 40 K at 3.0 GPa with no predom-<lb/>inant AF fluctuations <ref type="biblio">13,14</ref> . The La1111 series under<lb/> high pressure is the only material available for investi-<lb/>gating the magnetic properties of pnictides with T c in<lb/> the range of 45-50 K. In fact, the Sm1111 series marks<lb/> the highest T c (T c =55 K) in all types of iron-based pnic-<lb/>tides <ref type="biblio">15</ref> ; however, it includes magnetic Sm ions, which<lb/></p>

			<p>hinders the investigation of the magnetic properties of<lb/> iron-basal planes. The rise of T c without AF fluctuations<lb/> was observed only for x = 0.14 (see the dashed arrow in<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>), because AF fluctuations remain in a lower dop-<lb/>ing range than x = 0.14 and unfortunately x = 0.14 is<lb/> nearly the highest level of F doping. So far as nuclear-<lb/>magnetic-resonance (NMR) studies on LaFeAsO 1−x F x<lb/> are concerned, the maximum doping level is less than<lb/> x = 0.14 − 0.15 <ref type="biblio">16,17</ref> . To establish the breakdown of this<lb/> scenario over a wide doping range (0.20 ≤ x ≤ 0.44) that<lb/> covers the second SC dome, we applied 75 As (I=3/2)<lb/> NMR to the powder samples of the H-doped La1111 se-<lb/>ries at 3.0 GPa.<lb/></p>

			<p>We applied a pressure of 3.0 GPa to samples with<lb/> x =0.20, 0.40, and 0.44. The pressure was applied by us-<lb/>ing NiCrAl-CuBe hybrid piston-cylinder-type cells. We<lb/> used a mixture of F-70 and F-77 fluorinate as the pres-<lb/>sure mediation liquid. The details of the pressure cells<lb/> are given in Ref. <ref type="biblio">18</ref>. A coil wound around the samples<lb/> inside the pressure cell and capacitors equipped with a<lb/> NMR probe form the tank circuit, which serves to de-<lb/>tect the detuning of the resonance frequency, namely<lb/> the ac susceptibility and to detect the NMR signal as<lb/> well. The NMR measurements were performed using a<lb/> conventional coherent pulsed-NMR spectrometer. The<lb/> 75 As-NMR spectra show a broad powder pattern with<lb/> double edges <ref type="biblio">14</ref> , which originates from the second-order<lb/> quadrupole effect under a magnetic field. The relaxation<lb/> time (T 1 ) for 75 As was measured by using the saturation-<lb/>recovery method at the lower-field edge in the field-swept<lb/> NMR spectra. The low-field edge appears at about 48.2<lb/> kOe for an NMR frequency of 35.1 MHz. The signals at<lb/></p>

			<p>the low-field edge come from the powder samples with<lb/> the iron-basal planes parallel to the applied field. Fig-<lb/>ures <ref type="figure">2(a)-2(c)</ref> show the evolution of the relaxation rate<lb/> (1/T 1 ) divided by temperature (T ), ( i.e., 1/T 1 T ). Here,<lb/> we chose T c as the onset of 1/T 1 T as plotted as arrows<lb/> in Figs. <ref type="figure">2(a)-2(c)</ref>. For x =0.20, 1/T 1 T just above T c<lb/> exhibited plateaus as shown by dotted lines in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a)</ref>,<lb/> and T c was remarkably enhanced upon applying pres-<lb/>sure. For x =0.40 and 0.44, an anomaly was observed in<lb/> a paramagnetic state as marked as T * , and both T * and<lb/> T c were unchanged upon applying pressure. For x=0.44,<lb/> Curie-Weiss-like behavior, which implies AF fluctuations,<lb/> appears above T * at 0.1 MPa; however, this behavior has<lb/> no appreciable effect on T c .<lb/> Note that T c was determined under the applied field.<lb/> In general, T c decreases more or less under an applied<lb/> field; however, the decrease is significantly suppressed be-<lb/>cause we measured 1/T 1 T for the powder samples with<lb/> the iron-basal planes parallel to the applied field. In fact,<lb/> the values of T c are in good agreement with those de-<lb/>termined from the detuning of resonance frequency at<lb/> zero field. In this measurement, T c can be determined<lb/> from the extrapolation as shown as dashed lines in Figs.<lb/> <ref type="figure">3(a)-3(c)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the doping dependence of T c<lb/> determined from the resistivity 1 and 1/T 1 T . The data<lb/> at 3.0 GPa for the low-doping regime are cited from the<lb/> results of the F-doped La1111 series <ref type="biblio">14,19</ref> . As highlighted<lb/> by the solid arrow in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, T c increases to 48K at 3.0<lb/> GPa, which is comparable to the highest T c (∼55 K) for<lb/> all types of iron-based superconductors marked in the<lb/> Sm1111 series.<lb/></p>

		<p>In general, 1/T 1 T of d-electrons systems is determined<lb/> by spin correlations and is expressed by using the imagi-<lb/>nary part of the dynamical spin susceptibility Imχ(q, ω)<lb/> as 1/T 1 T ∝ Imχ(q, ω N )/ω N , where ω N is the angular fre-<lb/>quency of nuclei. When the interaction between electrons<lb/> is significantly strong, namely spin fluctuations are pre-<lb/>dominant, Curie-Weiss-like behavior is derived, whereas,<lb/> when the interaction is week, 1/T 1 T is determined by<lb/> the density of states (DOS) at Fermi surfaces. Unlike<lb/> other pnictides, Curie-Weiss-like behavior is not observ-<lb/>able for x = 0.20 as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a)</ref>. Another example is<lb/> K y Fe 2−x Se 2 with T c = 30 K <ref type="biblio">20</ref> : The compound exhibits<lb/> similar T dependence to the La1111 series. The results<lb/> in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a)</ref> demonstrate that T c is enhanced without<lb/> appreciable low-frequency AF fluctuations, which is the<lb/> most important result for this study. The absence of AF<lb/> fluctuations has also been confirmed from the neutron-<lb/>scattering measurements in both LaFeAsO 1−x H x<lb/> <ref type="biblio">21</ref> and<lb/> LaFeAsO 1−x F x<lb/> <ref type="biblio">22</ref> : An inelastic-scattering peak is absent<lb/> for x =0.20, despite the fact that it is unambiguously ob-<lb/>servable near the AF phase.<lb/></p>

		<p>Herein, the T dependence of 1/T 1 T is attributable<lb/> to the DOS. The monotonous T dependence at high<lb/> temperatures is attributed to the DOS involved only<lb/> at high temperatures. In fact, the photoemission spec-<lb/>troscopy measurements demonstrate that the DOS for<lb/> LaFeAsO 1−x F x decreases with decreasing temperature<lb/> <ref type="biblio">23</ref> . This scenario is approved by quantitative evaluation<lb/> of 1/T 1 T just at the plateau. We evaluate 1/T 1 T using<lb/> the Korringa relation <ref type="biblio">24,25</ref> for d-electron alloys <ref type="biblio">26</ref> :<lb/></p>

				<label>(1)<lb/></label>

		<p>where γ N , A hf and n i (ε F ) represent the gyromagnetic ra-<lb/>tio of 75 As (7.292 MHz/10 kOe), the hyperfine coupling<lb/> constant and DOS at Fermi surfaces for i = d xy , d yz , and<lb/> d zx orbits, respectively. The factor α Q is Iχ(Q) where<lb/> I is the interaction between electrons and χ(Q) is the<lb/> susceptibility without the interaction at dominant wave<lb/> number Q. The value of A hf has been estimated to be<lb/> ∼25 kOe/µ B from the K − χ plot <ref type="biblio">27</ref> . The theoretically<lb/> calculated values of n i (ε F ) for x =0.20 at ambient pres-<lb/>sure are 0.62, 0.92, and 0.92 (eV −1 ), respectively, for<lb/> i = d xy , d yz and d zx orbits 1 . These values result in<lb/> 1/T 1 T = 4.96 × 10 −4<lb/> 1<lb/> (1−αQ) 2 (s −1 K −1 ). The plateau of<lb/> 1/T 1 T at 0.1 MPa indicates 0.018 (s −1 K −1 ), and thus<lb/> α Q = 0.83. The value is in good agreement with the the-<lb/>oretically estimated value α Q = 0.94 for x = 0.20 <ref type="biblio">28</ref> . At<lb/> high temperatures, 1/T 1 T at 3.0 GPa is almost the same<lb/></p>

		<p>as that at 0.1 MPa, which suggests that α Q is insensi-<lb/>tive to pressure and thus α Q is not a key parameter for<lb/> increasing T c .<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">5(a)</ref> shows the plateaus observed for 14% F-<lb/>doped samples <ref type="biblio">13,14</ref> . The T c enhancement upon applying<lb/> pressure is highlighted by the dashed arrow in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. At<lb/> 0.1 MPa, the values of 1/T 1 T at T c , (1/T 1 T ) c are 0.023<lb/> and 0.018 (s −1 K −1 ) for 14% F-and 20% H-doped sam-<lb/>ples, respectively. At 3.0 GPa, these numbers increase to<lb/> 0.030 and 0.044, respectively. These data are plotted in<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">5(b)</ref>. The data for 40% and 44% H-doped sam-<lb/>ples are also plotted for comparison. As seen from the<lb/> figure, T c correlates with (1/T 1 T ) c only for 14% F-and<lb/> 20% H-doped samples reflecting n i (ε F ) in Eq. <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>.<lb/></p>

		<p>Our results for the La1111 series demonstrate that<lb/> T c is not directly affected by AF fluctuations as clearly<lb/> seen from Figs. <ref type="figure">2(a) and 2(c)</ref>. Note that the oppo-<lb/>site conclusion was derived for the Na111 series, such<lb/> as NaFe 1−x Co x As 10 . In the Na111 series, T c follows AF<lb/> fluctuations when pressure is applied. At first sight, the<lb/> results of the Na111 series seem to contradict the results<lb/> reported herein. One may classify the La1111 series as<lb/> an exotic and exceptional compound among iron-based<lb/> pnictides. However, all facts including the La1111 and<lb/> Na111 series are consistent if the superconductivity is<lb/> not directly affected by antiferromagnetism or AF fluc-<lb/>tuations. For all iron-based pnictides without exception,<lb/> 1/T 1 T becomes stronger as the doping level approaches<lb/> the AF-phase boundary, but the T c optimal doping level<lb/> is not always located on the AF-phase boundary and de-<lb/>pends on the compounds, which causes an apparent dis-<lb/>crepancy.<lb/></p>

			<p>Roughly speaking, T c is proportional to the DOS and<lb/> the paring interaction. The enhancement of the paring<lb/> interaction is hardly expected for the AF-fluctuation-<lb/>mediated scenario. As another candidate, the orbital-<lb/>fluctuation-mediated scenario <ref type="biblio">28</ref> would be promising. In<lb/> this case, orbital fluctuations are difficult to observe in<lb/> 1/T 1 T at a doping level where the structural or nematic<lb/> phase is absent, and thus the increase in T c is observable<lb/> via the DOS alone in 1/T 1 T . To investigate whether the<lb/> paring interaction is enhanced simultaneously as well as<lb/> the DOS, further theoretical investigations are needed;<lb/> however, the results of Fig. <ref type="figure">5(b)</ref> would give an impor-<lb/>tant clue.<lb/></p>

			<p>One may consider another scenario where the pair-<lb/>ing interaction originates from AF fluctuations, but AF<lb/> fluctuations are suppressed at ambient pressure by some<lb/> competing interactions such as orbital and/or charge in-<lb/>teractions. On the basis of this scenario, T c could be<lb/> suppressed and the double-dome structure could be ob-<lb/>served as observed in some high-T c cuprates. Pressure<lb/> could nullify the competition, and T c may increase un-<lb/>der pressure even if AF fluctuations are not enhanced.<lb/> However, the competing orders, which could cause ap-<lb/>preciable suppression of T c , have not been observed so<lb/> far in a wide range around x = 0.14 − 0.20. Furthermore,<lb/> AF fluctuations tend to decrease by applying pressure as<lb/> observed in the poorly F-doped regime <ref type="biblio">29</ref> or sufficiently<lb/> H-doped regime [See Fig. <ref type="figure">1(c)</ref>]. At present, there is no<lb/> experimental evidence to support this scenario.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, we have observed in LaFeAsO 1−x H x<lb/> that T c for x = 0.20 marks a high T c of 48 K upon ap-<lb/>plying pressure without the influence of AF fluctuations.<lb/> For x = 0.44 (near the second AF-phase boundary), T c<lb/> remains unchanged without depending on the magnitude<lb/> of AF fluctuations. These results suggest that the super-<lb/>conductivity has no direct connection with AF fluctua-<lb/>tions. So far as the results of 1/T 1 T are concerned, the<lb/> increase in T c up to 48 K originates from an enhancement<lb/> of the DOS just above T c .</p>
