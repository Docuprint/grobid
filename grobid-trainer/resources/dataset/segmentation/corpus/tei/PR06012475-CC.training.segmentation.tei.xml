			<body>The anisotropy of the high T c cuprates, coupled with <lb/>their short coherence lengths, gives rise to a complex <lb/>magnetic phase diagram, featuring a vortex liquid state <lb/>located between the vortex solid and the normal state <lb/>[1-3]. In particular, in the high T c cuprates, the vortex <lb/>lattice can melt at temperatures well below the onset of <lb/>short-range superconducting order occurring at the up-<lb/>per critical magnetic field H c2 . In a fixed temperature <lb/>experiment, this is evidenced by the onset of resistiv-<lb/>ity due to vortex motion well below the magnetic field <lb/>at which the normal-state resistivity is restored, defined <lb/>as the resistively-determined upper critical magnetic <lb/>field, H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ). Resistivity measurements on overdoped <lb/>Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO y (Tl-2201) [4] and overdoped Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO y <lb/>(Bi-2201) [5] have found a strong upward curvature in <lb/>H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) with no evidence of saturation at low temper-<lb/>atures. Such an H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) curve contrasts strongly with <lb/>the conventional Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) <lb/>theory for superconductors with weak electron-phonon <lb/>coupling [6], in which H c2 (T ) exhibits negative curvature <lb/>and saturates at low temperatures. Similarly anoma-<lb/>lous H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) curves have been discussed in connection <lb/>with other anisotropic superconductors, such as the or-<lb/>ganic superconductors [7]. However, due to the extremely <lb/>large upper critical fields, studies of the resistive transi-<lb/>tion in the cuprates have been largely limited to samples <lb/>in which T c and H c2 are greatly suppressed [8], either <lb/>in strongly underdoped [9] or overdoped samples [4,5], <lb/>in deliberately impurity-doped samples [10], or in the <lb/>electron-doped cuprates [11]. <lb/>In addition to the unusual &apos;shape&apos; of the H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) curves, <lb/>a re-examination of the origin and meaning of the re-<lb/>sistive transition in the cuprates is fueled, in part, by <lb/>specific heat [12], Raman spectroscopy [13] and magneti-<lb/>zation [14] measurements which indicate that the onset of <lb/>local superconducting order [generally interpreted as the <lb/>mean-field H c2 (T )] in Tl-2201 occurs at magnetic fields <lb/>well above H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ). At this mean-field H c2 (T ), no feature <lb/>is observed in the measured resistivity. Perhaps more <lb/>surprisingly, the experimental evidence for this mean-<lb/>field H c2 (T ), in both the specific heat and Raman ex-<lb/>periments, is anomalously and dramatically suppressed <lb/>by magnetic fields of only a few tesla. Thus, H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) <lb/>does not seem to correspond to the mean-field H c2 (T ), <lb/>which might suggest that it corresponds to the melting <lb/>of the vortex lattice. The difficulty with this interpreta-<lb/>tion of H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) is that it is unclear why the melted vortex <lb/>state should be (or can be) indistinguishable in resistivity <lb/>measurements from the normal state. More specifically, <lb/>if H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) corresponds to the irreversibility line, then the <lb/>magnetic phase diagram (at least for Tl-2201 and Bi-<lb/>2201) contains an unusual vortex liquid state whose resis-<lb/>tivity apparently equals the normal-state resistivity and <lb/>exhibits no substantial magnetic-field or temperature de-<lb/>pendence [4,5]. In light of the debate about the magnetic <lb/>phase diagram and the interpretation of H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) in the <lb/>cuprates, a systematic study of H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ), particularly in <lb/>optimally-doped compounds, is clearly desirable. <lb/>In this paper, we present resistivity measurements in <lb/>61-T pulsed magnetic fields which determine H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) for <lb/>La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) of various carrier concentrations <lb/>x. In addition to LSCO, we present H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) data for <lb/>nearly optimally doped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O y (Bi-2212) and <lb/>YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (YBCO). We find that the &apos;shape&apos; of the <lb/>H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) changes monotonically with the anisotropy of the <lb/>normal state of the sample, becoming more conventional <lb/>as the anisotropy gets smaller. The magnitude of the <lb/>positive curvature in H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ), along with the steep slope <lb/>of H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) at the lowest experimental temperature, are <lb/>the greatest in the most anisotropic compounds. <lb/></body>

			<body>The LSCO crystals, grown by the traveling-solvent <lb/>floating-zone method by the University of Tokyo groups, <lb/>have been previously studied in pulsed magnetic fields <lb/>[15]; the samples reported here with Sr concentrations <lb/>x=0.08 and 0.17 are grown by the Kishio group and those <lb/>with x=0.15 are grown by the Uchida group. The Bi-2212 <lb/>crystals, grown by the Kishio group using the floating-<lb/>zone method, are heat-treated in sealed quartz tubes to <lb/>tune to the near-optimum doping. Finally, the YBCO <lb/>crystals are grown at Bell Laboratories by a flux method <lb/>in zirconia crucibles and annealed in sealed quartz tubes <lb/>to tune the oxygen content to optimal doping. The resis-<lb/>tivity of each sample was measured at a given fixed tem-<lb/>perature during the magnetic field pulse using a ∼100 <lb/>kHz lockin technique [15,16]. No significant eddy current <lb/>heating resulted from the time-varying magnetic field. <lb/>To avoid additional dissipation due to vortex depinning <lb/>in response to an applied Lorenz force, the current was <lb/>applied parallel to the magnetic field (along the c axis), <lb/>except in the case of the YBCO crystal, whose shape <lb/>and the relatively small electrical anisotropy precluded <lb/>this geometry. <lb/>Figure 1(a) shows a representative set of raw exper-<lb/>imental traces, the c-axis resistivity ρ c vs H of LSCO <lb/>(x=0.15) at various temperatures. The onset field H onset <lb/>is defined as the magnetic field at which the resistiv-<lb/>ity first is detected to deviate from zero in the ρ vs H <lb/>plot. This definition is our best determination of the <lb/>irreversibility line, given the limited sensitivity of the <lb/>pulsed-field data. To characterize the rest of the resis-<lb/>tive transition in the H vs T plane, we determine those <lb/>magnetic fields at which the resistivity equals 10%, 50%, <lb/>80%, and 90% of the &quot;normal-state&quot; resistivity, denoted <lb/>H10, H50, H80, and H90, respectively [arrows in Fig. <lb/>1(a)]. In traditional superconductors, H50 is often asso-<lb/>ciated with the mean-field upper critical field H c2 ; how-<lb/>ever, given the uncertain interpretation of the resistive <lb/>transition in the cuprates, we make no a priori determi-<lb/>nation of H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) from the data. [We do note, in passing, <lb/>that H80(T ) is comparable to one common assignment <lb/>of H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ): the intersection of two straight line extrapo-<lb/>lations from the normal state resistivity and the steepest <lb/>slope in the transition region.] <lb/>At the lowest temperatures, as Fig. 1(a) illustrates, <lb/>even 61 T can be insufficient to recover the normal state. <lb/>In this regime, H onset remains unambiguous, but the <lb/>uncertainties in determining H10, H50, H80, and H90 <lb/>necessarily increase. In this regime, we extrapolate the <lb/>normal state resistivity to those lower temperatures at <lb/>which it cannot be measured directly. For the data of <lb/>Fig. 1(a), this is relatively straightforward since the <lb/>low-temperature normal-state resistivity in underdoped <lb/>LSCO obeys a log(1/T ) divergence [17]; for example, we <lb/>estimate the normal-state resistivity at 1.25 K to be 0.135 <lb/>Ωcm. The resulting errors in H10 etc. are estimated to <lb/>be about a few T even at the lowest temperatures.

Representative error bars are attached to the data. <lb/>LSCO (x=0.08), as shown in Fig. 1(b), no extrapolation <lb/>is required and thus the errors in H10 etc. are rather <lb/>small, less than 2 T. <lb/>Figure 2(a) shows the contours of the resistive transi-<lb/>tion of LSCO (x=0.15) in the H vs T plane, as deter-<lb/>mined from the data of Fig. 1(a). Representative error <lb/>bars are attached to the data. Note that the midpoint of <lb/>the transition, H50, shows a conventional linear temper-<lb/>ature dependence from T c down to T ≃ 0.5T c ; however, <lb/>it exhibits a steep rise at low temperatures below ∼ 10 <lb/>K, T ≃ 0.25T c . Note also that all of the curves exhibit <lb/>this sharp rise, which persists to the lowest experimental <lb/>temperature (T = 1.25 K ≃ 0.03T c ). Thus, regardless <lb/>of the precise determination of H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) from the ρ c vs H <lb/>curves in Fig. 1(a), H ρ <lb/>c2 in optimally-doped LSCO ex-<lb/>hibits no evidence of saturation at low temperatures, a <lb/>particularly unusual feature in common with previously-<lb/>reported data from overdoped Tl-2201 [4] and overdoped <lb/>Bi-2201 [5]. <lb/>Figure 2(b) shows the contours of the resistive tran-<lb/>sition for underdoped LSCO (x=0.08) in the H vs T <lb/>plane, constructed from the data of Fig. 1(b). Com-<lb/>pared to LSCO (x=0.15), the curves in Fig. 2(b) show <lb/>even greater upward curvature, extending from T c down <lb/>to the lowest experimental temperatures for all curves, <lb/>including H80(T ) and H90(T ). These data, when cou-<lb/>pled with the data for LSCO (x=0.17) [shown later], sug-<lb/>gest a monotonic dependence in which the magnitude of <lb/>the upward curvature increases with decreasing carrier <lb/>concentration. We emphasize that 61 T is sufficient to <lb/>suppress superconductivity in LSCO (x=0.08) and thus <lb/>all the data points in Fig. 2(b) have rather small error <lb/>bars. Therefore, even though the raw resistive transition <lb/>in Fig. 1(b) is much broader compared to the overdoped <lb/>Tl-2201 [4] or Bi-2201 [5], all the definitions for H ρ <lb/>c2 are <lb/>unambiguously indicating an unusual upward curvature <lb/>of H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) in this underdoped LSCO. <lb/>Figure 3 contains the raw R vs H data for three <lb/>cuprates near optimum doping, Bi-2212, LSCO (x=0.17) <lb/>and YBCO. One may notice that the data for Bi-2212 <lb/>[Fig. 3(a)] show some linear background before the resis-<lb/>tance rapidly increases; we have not identified the cause <lb/>of this linear background, but we determined H onset for <lb/>this sample with the deviation from the linear back-<lb/>ground. One may also notice that the Bi-2212 data show <lb/>pronounced negative magnetoresistance in the high-field <lb/>normal state, particularly at low temperatures. <lb/>In Fig. 3, we show the data in resistance, rather than <lb/>in resistivity, to demonstrate that the noise level of our <lb/>pulsed-field experiments is not determined by the abso-<lb/>lute voltage but changes with the sample impedance; the <lb/>noise is always about a few percent of the impedance be-<lb/>ing measured (as long as the impedance is larger than a <lb/>few tens of mΩ). This fact precludes the usage of the <lb/>usual criteria for the irreversibility field defined by a cer-<lb/>tain electric-field threshold. This is the reason why we <lb/>needed to determine the onset field H onset rather naively <lb/>with the magnetic field at which the resistivity first is <lb/>detected to deviate from zero in the ρ vs H plot. <lb/>In determining the normal-state resistance R n for the <lb/>samples shown in Fig. 3, we used a linear extrapolation <lb/>from higher temperatures; for example, we estimated R n <lb/>to be 33 Ω at 3.0 K for Bi-2212, 1.08 Ω at 1.55 K for LSCO <lb/>(x=0.17), and 14.6 mΩ at 50 K for YBCO. One can infer <lb/>from Fig. 3 that R n of Bi-2212 and LSCO (x=0.17) be-<lb/>comes relatively temperature independent at low temper-<lb/>atures and therefore the errors involved in the estimation <lb/>of R n are relatively small compared to that for YBCO. <lb/>The data in Fig. 3(c) show large positive &quot;magnetoresis-<lb/>tance&quot;, particularly at lower temperatures, which makes <lb/>the definition of R n rather ambiguous. As a result, the <lb/>estimated errors for H10 etc. are comparatively large for <lb/>YBCO. These very broad resistive transitions of YBCO <lb/>suggest that the idea of the &quot;resistive upper critical field&quot; <lb/>at which the normal-state resistivity is restored might be <lb/>a questionable concept for some of the high-T c cuprates. <lb/>Figure 4 shows the contours of the resistive transitions <lb/></body>

			<body>in the H vs T plane for the three cuprates at near opti-<lb/>mum doping, deduced from the data in Fig. 3. Repre-<lb/>sentative error bars are attached to the data. To corrob-<lb/>orate the pulsed-magnetic-field data with more conven-<lb/>tional measurements, we also plot the H c2 (T ) lines de-<lb/>termined from the reversible magnetization (thick dashed <lb/>lines): in Fig. 4(b), for LSCO (x=0.17) crystals from the <lb/>same source [18] and, in Fig. 4(c), the frequently-cited <lb/>line of -1.9 T/K for YBCO [19]. Note that in each case <lb/>the H c2 line determined from the reversible magnetiza-<lb/>tion lies near the midpoint of the resistive transition, the <lb/>H50 line. In Fig. 4(c), the open diamonds denote the <lb/>first-order vortex lattice melting transition line obtained <lb/>by Safar et al. [20] and this line agrees quite well with <lb/>our H onset (filled diamonds). <lb/>The data in Fig. 4 are arranged in order of decreasing <lb/>normal-state anisotropy, ρ c /ρ ab . Note that the anoma-<lb/>lous upward curvature, d 2 H ρ /dT 2 &gt; 0, is greatest in <lb/>the more anisotropic materials. This curvature decreases <lb/>monotonically, until for YBCO the H80 and H90 curves <lb/>exhibit the more conventional negative curvature. We <lb/>note that this trend does not depend monotonically on <lb/>the magnitude of T c , for example. Furthermore, ob-<lb/>servation of this trend among different optimally-doped <lb/>cuprates suggests that the carrier-concentration depen-<lb/>dence found in LSCO may arise simply from the decreas-<lb/>ing normal-state anisotropy which accompanies increas-<lb/>ing carrier concentration. <lb/>The H vs T diagrams shown in Figs. 2 and 4 clearly <lb/>indicate that, for all the cuprates studied, the unconven-<lb/>tional upward curvature is common for H onset over the <lb/>entire temperature range studied here. The anisotropy <lb/>and short coherence length of the cuprates give a phase <lb/>diagram with a vortex liquid regime between the vor-<lb/>tex solid and the normal state [3]. The width of the <lb/>vortex liquid regime is expected to increase with increas-<lb/>ing anisotropy [21]. It is most likely that our H onset <lb/>is closely related to the irreversibility line, H irr (T ), as-<lb/>sociated with the vortex liquid-to-solid transition, which <lb/>would be expected to exhibit the observed monotonic de-<lb/>pendence on anisotropy. <lb/>The interpretation of the rest of the resistive transition, <lb/>characterized by the H10, H50, H80 and H90 curves <lb/>of Figs. 2 and 4, is not so clear. Nonetheless, obvious <lb/>trends appear in the data. For all the cuprates stud-<lb/>ied, the unconventional upward curvature seen in H onset <lb/>is also seen in H10 and H50 over the entire temperature <lb/>range studied; however, the upward curvature is observed <lb/>in the higher resistance contours, H80 and H90, only <lb/>in such highly anisotropic systems as Bi-2212 or under-<lb/>doped LSCO. On the other hand, the lack of saturation <lb/>of H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) at low temperatures seems to be a more ro-<lb/>bust feature of the resistive transition. Thus, while there <lb/>is a substantial literature addressing the resistive transi-<lb/>tion and H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) in the cuprates [7], a successful theory <lb/>would need to account for the following new phenomenol-<lb/>ogy: (i) Among the optimally-doped cuprates, H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) <lb/>can exhibit a global positive curvature, but only in the <lb/>more anisotropic compounds. (ii) As the anisotropy is <lb/>decreased, the anomalous upward curvature disappears <lb/>near T c in the upper part of the resistive transition, i.e. <lb/>in the H80 and H90 curves. (iii) There is no evidence <lb/>of saturation in H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) in any of the cuprates studied in <lb/>the low temperature limit. <lb/>Several dramatically contrasting models for H c2 (T ) <lb/>have found global positive curvature: for example, local-<lb/>ization of charged bosons in the small coherence length <lb/>limit [22], scattering from magnetic impurities which or-<lb/>der at low temperatures [23], influence of a quantum crit-<lb/>ical point associated with melting of the vortex lattice <lb/>[24], and mixing of d xy and d x 2 <lb/>−y 2 components due to <lb/>the magnetic field [25]. For many of the above models, <lb/>the effect of anisotropy is not yet clear. Our data clearly <lb/>indicate that the normal state anisotropy plays a key <lb/>role, perhaps the key role, in determining the curvature <lb/>of H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ). <lb/>In summary, we characterize the resistive transition for <lb/>a variety of optimally-doped high-T c cuprates using 61-T <lb/>pulsed magnetic fields. The anomalous positive curva-<lb/>ture of both H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) and H ρ <lb/>irr (T ) is strongest in the more <lb/>anisotropic cuprates. None of the samples studied show <lb/>saturation of H ρ <lb/>c2 (T ) or H ρ <lb/>irr (T ) at low temperatures. <lb/></body>
