			<body>The c-axis magnetic penetration depth λ c in high-T c <lb/>superconductors (HTS) is a key parameter for under-<lb/>standing the interlayer dynamics of electrons. It is also <lb/>important for assessing the proposed pairing mechanism <lb/>arising from in-plane confinement, namely the interlayer <lb/>tunneling (ILT) theory which was proposed by Ander-<lb/>son and co-workers [1-4]. Although great effort has been <lb/>devoted to the accurate measurement of λ c , the exper-<lb/>imental results are still controversial. For example, for <lb/>optimally doped La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 , optical [5] and surface <lb/>impedance [6] measurements found λ c (T = 0K) ≃ 4µm, <lb/>in agreement with the prediction of ILT theory. On <lb/>the other hand for Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+x , vortex imaging [7] <lb/>and optical [8] measurements yielded λ c (0) ≃ 19µm, <lb/>and more recent optical measurements gave 12µm [9]. <lb/>These high values of λ c (0) cannot be easily accounted <lb/>by the ILT model [10]. Furthermore, for nearly opti-<lb/>mally doped HgBa 2 CuO 4+x (T c = 96K), the values of <lb/>λ c (0) obtained by vortex imaging [11] and optical [12] <lb/>measurements are ≃ 8µm and 6µm, respectively. How-<lb/>ever, ac-susceptibility measurements for slightly over-<lb/>doped HgBa 2 CuO 4+x (T c =93K) give λ c (0) ≃ 1.5µm [13] <lb/>in agreement with ILT theory. The large discrepancies <lb/>in the reported values of λ c (0) for HTS with one CuO 2 <lb/>plane per unit cell makes it difficult to reach a consensus <lb/>regarding the trends of λ c (0) in HTS and also the validity <lb/>of the ILT model [10,14-16]. Moreover, the strong dop-<lb/>ing dependence of both the superconducting and normal <lb/>state properties [17] and the presence of the pseudogap <lb/>in under-and optimally doped samples may play a signif-<lb/>icant role in the behaviour of the c-axis electrodynamics. <lb/>It is therefore important to study the c-axis superfluid re-<lb/>sponse as a function of carrier concentration and search <lb/>for possible correlations between the in-plane and out-of-<lb/>plane superconducting properties and the normal state <lb/>pseudogap. <lb/>In this paper we report high quality data for λ c , mea-<lb/>sured by the ac-susceptibility technique, as functions of <lb/>doping and temperature for La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) and <lb/>HgBa 2 CuO 4+x (Hg-1201). We find that λ c (0) changes <lb/>rapidly with doping when p &lt; 0.20, and is almost inde-<lb/>pendent of doping for p ≥ 0.20, where p is the hole con-<lb/>centration per planar Cu atom. A crossover near p = 0.20 <lb/>is also observed in the behaviour of the temperature de-<lb/>pendence of λ −2 <lb/>c , similar to that previously reported for <lb/>the in-plane counterpart, λ −2 <lb/>ab [18], suggesting that it is <lb/>also strongly affected by the presence of the normal state <lb/>pseudogap. The doping dependence of λ c (0) shown here <lb/>lends some support to the ILT model in the sense that it <lb/>can account for the discrepancies in the reported values <lb/>of λ c (0) for Hg-1201. <lb/>The samples studied here were magnetically aligned <lb/>high quality single-phase powders of La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 <lb/>(p = x = 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.22 and 0.24) [18] and <lb/>HgBa 2 CuO 4+x (x=0.10, i.e., p=0.09, with T c =60 K) [19]. <lb/>Measurements were performed down to 1.2K for LSCO <lb/>and 4.2K for Hg-1201 using the low-field ac-susceptibility <lb/>technique with an ac-field of 1G RM S at 333Hz parallel <lb/>to the CuO 2 planes. For LSCO the value of p is taken <lb/>to be equal to the Sr content x, whereas for Hg-1201 it <lb/>was determined by estimating the oxygen content and <lb/>verified by thermopower measurements as in ref. [19]. <lb/>Transport, magnetic and spectroscopic measurements <lb/>confirmed the high quality of our samples. The data <lb/>were analysed using London&apos;s model for small aligned <lb/>crystallites of anisotropic HTS. Details of the technique <lb/>and data analysis can be found elsewhere [20,13]. The <lb/>low-field ac-susceptibility technique gives the fractional <lb/>diamagnetism of a superconductor and thus is a direct <lb/>probe of the magnetic penetration depth [13]. For each <lb/>doping concentration of LSCO, the result presented here <lb/>is typical of those obtained for four samples prepared in-<lb/>dependently from the same polycrystalline pellet. Each <lb/>of these samples was aligned at different times and from <lb/>each sample 4 pieces were cut and measured. Therefore <lb/>a total of 16 samples were investigated for each doping <lb/>content. In the case of Hg-1201, two samples were pre-<lb/>pared from the same polycrystalline pellet and again 4 <lb/>pieces of each aligned sample were cut and measured for <lb/></body>

		<body>each doping level. The error of λ c (0) is estimated to be <lb/>&lt; 8% for LSCO and &lt; 10% for Hg-1201, while the error <lb/>in the relative temperature dependence λ c (T )/λ c (0) is &lt; <lb/>1% and is therefore negligible. <lb/>Fig. 1(a) shows the doping dependence of λ c (0) for <lb/>LSCO and Hg-1201. Lets us first discuss the case of <lb/>LSCO. For comparison our previously published data of <lb/>λ ab (0) for the same LSCO samples are also included [18]. <lb/>The ratio of λ c (0)/λ ab (0) measures the electromagnetic <lb/>anisotropy γ of the system. The values of γ for the sam-<lb/>ples we measured are shown in Fig 1(b) and compared <lb/>with those obtained by Shibauchi et al. for LSCO sin-<lb/>gle crystals with x &lt; 0.20 using the surface impedance <lb/>technique [6]. There is very good agreement between the <lb/>two sets of data despite the large error bars in Fig. 2(a) <lb/>of ref. [6]. From Fig. 1 we find that for the intermedi-<lb/>ate doping regime, 0.14 &lt; x &lt; 0.20, T c does not change <lb/>very much, although there are significant changes in λ c (0) <lb/>and γ. Namely, λ c (0), λ ab (0) and γ increase rapidly for <lb/>x = p &lt; 0.20 holes/Cu and are nearly independent of <lb/>doping for x = p ≥ 0.20 with λ c (0) ≃ 2µm and γ ≃ 12. <lb/>Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of the <lb/>c-axis superfluid density of LSCO as a function of doping. <lb/>There is a noticeable change in the curvature of λ −2 <lb/>c (T ) <lb/>near 0.20 holes/Cu as previously observed in λ −2 <lb/>ab (T ) and <lb/>shown in Fig. 2(b) for comparison [18]. The relatively <lb/>sudden change in curvature as well as in the absolute val-<lb/>ues of λ −2 <lb/>ab,c near x = 0.20 is not a feature unique to the <lb/>superfluid response. It has also been observed in several <lb/>other physical quantities, both in the normal and super-<lb/>conducting states, and attributed to the opening of the <lb/>pseudogap in the low doping regime [21-25]. The physi-<lb/>cal mechanism leading to the normal state pseudogap is <lb/>still unknown. However, it is generally believed to cause <lb/>a loss of the normal state spectral weight near the Fermi <lb/>energy [18,21,26]. The loss of spectral weight is expected <lb/>to strongly suppress the superfluid density λ −2 <lb/>ab,c and alter <lb/>the temperature dependence of both λ ab and λ c [26-29]. <lb/>By comparing the data of λ c (0) for LSCO with those <lb/>for Hg-1201, we find that the doping dependences of λ c (0) <lb/>in these two compounds are very similar [Fig. 1(a)]. <lb/>Namely, for an underdoped, an almost optimally doped <lb/>(measured independently by two different techniques), <lb/>and two overdoped Hg-1201 samples, with p ∼ 0.09 [this <lb/>work], 0.16 [11] and [12], 0.18 [13] and 0.23 [30] ±0.01 and <lb/>T c = (60K, 96K [11], 96K [12], 93K [13] and 60K [30]), <lb/>the values of the c-axis penetration depth are ≃ (8.5µm, <lb/>8 ± 1µm [11], 6 ± 1µm [12], 1.5µm [13] and 2µm [30]), <lb/>respectively. These results are shown in Fig. 1(a) to-<lb/>gether with the LSCO data for comparison. The doping <lb/>content for Hg-1201 was estimated using the universal <lb/>relation T c =T c,max [1-82.6(p-0.16) 2 ], where the maximum <lb/>is reached for an optimum doping of p ≃ 0.16 holes per <lb/>CuO 2 plane [31]. In the case of Hg-1201 T c,max is cho-<lb/>sen to be 96K. For the samples studied here and in refs <lb/>[13,30] the values of p estimated were confirmed from <lb/>thermoelectric power measurements as in ref. [19]. Al-<lb/>though there is some uncertainty in determining the value <lb/>of p in Hg-1201, these results indicate that the doping <lb/>dependence of λ c (0) is qualitatively similar for these two <lb/>single-layer high-T c cuprates. <lb/>Our results show that there is no experimental incon-<lb/>sistency in the wide range of λ c (0) values reported in the <lb/>literature for the Hg-1201 compound. Namely, the value <lb/>of 1.5µm that we obtained [13] for a slightly overdoped <lb/>sample by the ac-susceptibility technique corresponds to <lb/>the simple situation where there is no normal state gap. <lb/>Although the values of Kirtley et al. [11] and Basov et <lb/>al. [12] correspond to samples with high values of T c <lb/>(96K) the results shown here strongly suggest that their <lb/>values of λ c (0) correspond to significantly lower doping <lb/>levels where the normal state gap comes into play. In <lb/>this sense our results support the ILT model-since the <lb/>only clear exception to this model is now the Tl-2201 <lb/>compound [7-9]. However, we should note that for any <lb/>pairing mechanism (not just ILT) the presence of the <lb/>normal state gap also leads to a similar correlation be-<lb/>tween the condensation energy, and the superfluid den-<lb/>sity, i.e., λ c (0) and λ ab (0) [21,26]. There are also dis-<lb/>tinct differences between λ c and λ ab . The anisotropy γ <lb/>increases on the underdoped side and the T -dependences <lb/>at low temperatures (at T &lt; 0.3T c ) are very different. <lb/>Namely, the in-plane component varies always linearly <lb/>with T whereas the c-axis counterpart varies as T n with <lb/>n ≃ 3 for LSCO [this work] and n ≃ 5 for Hg-1201 [13]. <lb/>Details on possible mechanisms leading to these power <lb/>laws can be found in ref. [32]. Therefore, it is not imme-<lb/>diately obvious that the qualitative similarities between <lb/>λ c (T ) and λ ab (T ) shown in Fig. 2 can be understood <lb/>within the ILT theory where interplane Josephson effects <lb/>dominate the c-axis electrodynamics. <lb/>In summary, we have measured the effects of car-<lb/>rier concentration on the c-axis superfluid response of <lb/>two typical monolayer high-T c cuprates. We observe a <lb/>crossover in the behaviour of λ c (0, T ) near p = 0.20, <lb/>which is closely related to the opening of the pseudo-<lb/>gap. The strong doping dependence of λ c (0) for p &lt; 0.20 <lb/>provides an explanation for the discrepancies in the lit-<lb/>erature. The qualitatively similar behaviour of λ c and <lb/>λ ab as a function of doping suggests that both quanti-<lb/>ties are strongly affected by the presence of the normal <lb/>state pseudogap, as is the superconducting condensation <lb/>energy. <lb/></body>
