Rhyne <lb/>National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899 <lb/>(Received 24 January 1989) <lb/>The structure and magnetic properties of the Bi2Sr2Cui -&quot;M&quot;O» (M-Co and Fe) materials <lb/>were studied. The limits of solid solution formation are at x 0.5 for the Fe system and x 1 for <lb/>the Co system. Crystals of the new Bi2Sr2CoO~phase were grown and the structure established <lb/>by x-ray crystallography. <lb/>The subcell is the same as that of the 10-K superconductor, <lb/>Bi2Sr2CuO~, but the superstructure <lb/>is different, as it exhibits a commensurate modulation of <lb/>periodicity 4 instead of 5. Extra oxygen is accommodated in the Bi layers, as in Bi2Sr3Fe20&quot;,and <lb/>the structure of the Bi-0 layers can be described as 50% rocksalt type and 50% oxygen-deficient <lb/>perovskite for x 1, but with disorder at the oxygen positions. The formal valence of Co in this <lb/>compound is about 2.5+ 0.2 as deduced from structural and chemical measurements, whereas Fe <lb/>adopts the oxidation state +3 as deduced by Mossbauer measurements. Bi2Sr2COOy is an anti-<lb/>ferromagnetic insulator with the spins lying within the Co02 sheets and the antiferromagnetic or-<lb/>dering temperature (Tv) is sensitive to processing conditions and composition changes. The high <lb/>anisotropy of the susceptibility suggests that Bi2Sr2CoO~may be an Ising or XY antiferromagnet. <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Magnetic impurities in conventional superconductors <lb/>strongly depress the superconducting transition tempera-<lb/>ture T,. But in the new high-T, cuprates La2Cu04 and <lb/>YBa2Cu30», in which superconductivity is believed to be <lb/>confined within Cu02 planes, T, is depressed whether Cu <lb/>is replaced by magnetic or diamagnetic ions. &apos; 3 For <lb/>YBa2Cu30», however, the study of this depression of T, is <lb/>complicated because there are two different copper sites <lb/>that the impurity can occupy, as opposed to La2Cu04, <lb/>where there is only one. The Bi-based high-T, materials <lb/>of general formula Bi2Sr2Ca&quot; iCu&quot;O» with n 1, 2, and <lb/>3, where all the Cu atoms lie in Cu02 planes, &quot; is another <lb/>simpler system for studying the effect of magnetic impuri-<lb/>ties. <lb/>All of the Bi-based superconductors have an incom-<lb/>mensurate structural modulation. s We recently discussed <lb/>the crystal chemistry of this modulation within the 80-K <lb/>superconductor BizSr2CaCu20s+ <lb/>(n=2) in a study of <lb/>6 <lb/>the isostructural commensurate Bi~oSr~5Fe~0046 phase. <lb/>This study showed that the modulation is caused by the <lb/>insertion of extra oxygen in a perovskite position within <lb/>the Bi layers. The Bi2Sr2CuO» phase (n l ), whose basic <lb/>unit cell has been found to be either orthorhombic <lb/>or <lb/>face-centered monoclinic, has a commensurate modula-<lb/>tion of the structure, and it is likely that the modulation <lb/>has the same origin in all the Bi phases, but the structures <lb/>of the various compounds must be solved to verify this hy-<lb/>pothesis. <lb/>We have previously shown that Co and Fe can be sub-<lb/>stituted for Cu in the Bi2SrzCuO» phase. To address the <lb/>above questions of structural modulation and magnetism, <lb/>we have studied these substitutions on the Cu sites in more <lb/>detail. We have followed the evolution of magnetism and <lb/>the structural modulation as a function of the amount of <lb/>Cu replaced by Fe and Co. During this work, we syn-<lb/>thesized a structurally related Bi phase containing only <lb/>Co (Bi2Sr2CoO»), in both bulk or single-crystal form, and <lb/>solved its structure. We present both the structure and <lb/>the magnetic properties. We find that within this phase <lb/>the structural modulation is commensurate, and that the <lb/>magnetic properties suggest hidden ferromagnetism, simi-<lb/>lar to that found in La2Cu04 but with the canted com-<lb/>ponent of the spins lying in the CoOz planes. <lb/>SYNTHESIS <lb/>Samples of nominal composition BizSrzCu) -xM Oy <lb/>(M Co and Fe) were prepared by thoroughly mixing ap-<lb/>propriate amounts of the starting oxides and carbonates, <lb/>then heating the mixture in air for 24 h at temperatures <lb/>ranging from 860-900&apos;C and 900-950&apos;C when M Co <lb/>and Fe, respectively. Higher temperatures are required <lb/>for samples with increased doping content x. The reacted <lb/></body>

			<body>powders were then pressed into pellets, reannealed in air <lb/>at the above temperatures for 24 h, and rapidly cooled (at <lb/>10 /min) to room temperature. <lb/>X-ray studies of the resulting samples summarized in <lb/>Table I show that for M Co, single-phase materials are <lb/>obtained for all x. With M Fe the materials are multi-<lb/>phase for x greater than 0.6. The subcell parameters are <lb/>displayed in Fig. 1 as a function of x for the Bi2Sr2-<lb/>Cut -&quot;MO~series. The most prominent feature is the <lb/>sharp drop in the subcell volume at x 0.5 and x =0.25 <lb/>for the Co and Fe series, respectively, which might indi-<lb/>cate subtle structural changes. The powder patterns for <lb/>samples close to the Fe composition, x=0. 25, show the <lb/>coexistence of two sets of lines, indicating a noncontinuous <lb/>structural change. This is in contrast with the Co series <lb/>where (within the accuracy of the measurements) we did <lb/>not detect coexistence of two phases for compositions close <lb/>to x =0.5. <lb/>The atmosphere used during the processing of Bi2Sr2-<lb/>CoO~is important. When samples are annealed at 840&apos;C <lb/>under Ar, the structure is preserved, although the unit-cell <lb/>volume increases by 1 A . In contrast, when heated in ox-<lb/>ygen at 820&apos;C the material became multiphase as indi-<lb/>cated by its x-ray powder diffraction pattern which shows <lb/>two sets of Bragg peaks with the most intense ones corre-<lb/>sponding to the n =1 phase. Among the weak extra Bragg <lb/>peaks, the one at 28-6&apos; (for Cu radiation) suggests the <lb/>existence of another phase (denoted as the n-2 phase) <lb/>which will be discussed elsewhere. &apos; This &quot;n 2&quot; phase <lb/>becomes predominant when lower reannealing tempera-<lb/>tures ( &amp; 800&apos;C) under oxygen are used. <lb/>To determine the stability of the n=1 phase under <lb/>higher pressure of oxygen, we performed (as previously <lb/>reported for the synthesis of pure undoped BizSr2CuOp <lb/>hase&quot; ), solid-state reactions within sealed quartz am-<lb/>0.0 <lb/>0. 1 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.3 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.7 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>0.9 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>0.1 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.3 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>0.5&amp;x&amp;1 <lb/>M =Co <lb/>5.376 <lb/>5.381 <lb/>5.384 <lb/>5.393 <lb/>5.407 <lb/>5.411 <lb/>5.417 <lb/>5.422 <lb/>5.434 <lb/>5.450 <lb/>5.464 <lb/>M =Fe <lb/>5.388 <lb/>5.3&amp;5 <lb/>5.423 <lb/>5.418 <lb/>5.413 <lb/>24.56 <lb/>24.56 <lb/>24.41 <lb/>24.31 <lb/>24. 11 <lb/>23.99 <lb/>23.93 <lb/>23.87 <lb/>23.67 <lb/>23.59 <lb/>23.47 <lb/>24.47 <lb/>24.47 <lb/>23.87 <lb/>23.87 <lb/>23.87 <lb/>Multiphase <lb/>712.6 <lb/>711.1 <lb/>707.7 <lb/>707.1 <lb/>705.0 <lb/>702.4 <lb/>701.9 <lb/>701.8 <lb/>699.2 <lb/>700.9 <lb/>700.7 <lb/>710.5 <lb/>709.7 <lb/>702.4 <lb/>700.9 <lb/>699.6 <lb/>TABLE I.

From the volume of the <lb/>ampoule and the amount of Sr02, the pressure in the tube <lb/>was roughly estimated at 20 bars at temperatures of <lb/>800 C. The Fe and Co series were made using this tech-<lb/>nique at temperatures of 860&apos;C and 840&apos;C, respectively. <lb/>We found that Bi2Sr2Cu~-Co O~s ingle-phase materials <lb/>can only be obtained up to x 0.6, At higher Co concen-<lb/>trations, the material was multiphase containing the n =1 <lb/>phase and a layered phase &quot;n =2 or 2:3:0:2&quot;with a c-axis <lb/>of 29.8 A. The amount of this layered phase was found to <lb/>increase with increasing Co content, so that no Bragg <lb/>peaks corresponding to the n 1 phase could be detected <lb/>in the x-ray powder diffraction pattern of the x= 1 sam-<lb/>ple. For the Fe series, a less crucial eA&apos;ect was observed, <lb/>since a range of solubility was found to exist from 0 to <lb/>0.5~0.1 when the materials are prepared using Sr02 in <lb/>contrast to 0.6~0.1 when they are prepared in air. At <lb/>higher Fe concentrations we observed the formation of the <lb/>Bi2Sr3Fe209 2 (n =2) phase, whose structure has been dis-<lb/>cussed elsewhere. <lb/>These experiments demonstrate that <lb/>the x, T, P(02) phase diagram for the stability of the <lb/>Bi2Sr2CoO~is quite complex because of the n 2 phase as <lb/>the competing phase. The main results are that (1) <lb/>single-phase Bi2Sr2CoO~materials can be obtained in air <lb/>at temperatures of 870~30 C or at lower temperatures <lb/>in partially reducing ambient and (2) that lowering the <lb/>synthesis temperature either in air or oxygen, or increas-<lb/>ing the oxygen pressure at T=800 C, always result in a <lb/>multiphase <lb/>sample. <lb/>Synthesis under oxygen usually <lb/>favors the high oxidation state of the metal elements <lb/>695 &apos; <lb/>I <lb/>I <lb/>1 <lb/>425 <lb/>695 0 <lb/>0 25 <lb/>x In BI2 Sl&apos;2 CU1-x Mx Oy <lb/>FIG.

			<body>within a compound. Thus the observation that the 2:2:0:1 <lb/>is not stable under oxygen for high Co content or even in <lb/>air for high Fe content, suggests that the 2:2:0:1 phase <lb/>does not allow an oxidation state of Fe(Co) as great as the <lb/>2:3:0:2,as we will confirm shortly. <lb/>The oxygen content in this phase was determined <lb/>directly by thermogravimetric <lb/>measurements <lb/>(TGA) as <lb/>described elsewhere, &quot; or indirectly by chemical anal-<lb/>ysis. &apos; In the chemical method, the material is dissolved <lb/>in an acidified solution and the solution is titrated with a <lb/>second solution of Ce(SO4)2 (10 N). Ce + oxidizes <lb/>Co + to Co +, so the amount of Ce + consumed gives the <lb/>formal valence of Co and, thereby, the amount of oxygen, <lb/>assuming that Bi and Sr have a fixed valence of + 3 and <lb/>+2, respectively. By chemical analysis we found that the <lb/>formal valence for Co is 2.3+ 0.1, resulting in an oxygen <lb/>content of 6.15~0.05 per unit formula. A similar formal <lb/>valence for Co (within the accuracy of the titration) was <lb/>found for the material annealed under argon. TGA mea-<lb/>surements performed on several powdered samples and on <lb/>powdered single crystals consistently gave oxygen contents <lb/>ranging from 6.4 to 6.5. The discrepancy between the <lb/>chemical analysis and TGA may arise from loss of Bi dur-<lb/>ing the reduction under H2, because a reddish deposit was <lb/>observed along the wall of the TGA furnace during the <lb/>reduction experiment. <lb/>With the hope of determining more quantitatively how <lb/>the n 1 Co phase is affected by ambient, several TGA <lb/>(weight-loss measurements) were performed with identi-<lb/>cal results. A TGA trace is reported in the inset of Fig. 8 <lb/>for the Bi2Sr2CoO~phase heated in argon, cooled in ar-<lb/>gon, and then reheated in air. Note that up to tempera-<lb/>tures of 500&apos;C the weight loss (0.15%) of the sample <lb/>heated under argon is equal to its weight gain (0.15%) <lb/>when reheated under air, indicating a reversible intercala-<lb/>tion of 0.06 oxygen atoms per formula unit. At higher <lb/>temperatures the weight gain becomes smaller than the <lb/>weight loss, most likely due to a loss of Bi, which is quite <lb/>volatile at high temperatures, and especially so under vac-<lb/>uum. Thus, with respect to its oxygen affinity this com-<lb/>pound bears a striking similarity to Bi2Sr2CaCu20~and <lb/>La2CuO~for which a small ran~e of oxygen non-<lb/>stoichiometry (hy 0.04) was found. <lb/>Crystals of the Bi2Sr2CoO~phase (either in platelet or <lb/>needlelike form) were prepared in a dense alumina cruci-<lb/>ble ( -, in. diam and 2 in. high) containing an 11 g charge <lb/>composed of 60% Bi203, 31% SrCO3, and 9% Co304 by <lb/>weight. The charge was heated in air to 1000&apos;C over a <lb/>period of 6 h, maintained at this temperature for 2 h, <lb/>slowly cooled to 700&apos;C at a rate of 6&apos;C per h, and then <lb/>removed from the furnace at this temperature. This treat-<lb/>ment partially melted the material. Within the charge <lb/>were large cavities containing free crystals (sizes ranging <lb/>from several micrometers to 3 or 4 mm) that were used <lb/>for the structural and physical measurements reported <lb/>herein. <lb/>STRUCTURE <lb/>An 8-pm-thick platelet with metallic luster and specu-<lb/>lar reflection was selected and turned out to be an ortho-<lb/>rhombic crystal with space group 12mb and cell parame-<lb/>ters a 21.836(5), b 5.4615(8), c 23.450(4) A. The <lb/>plane of the platelet was (002). <lb/>The essential details of the structure data collection and <lb/>data reduction are given in Table II. Direct methods fol-<lb/>lowed by least-squares refinement and difference-Fourier <lb/>maps gave the atomic positions in Table III. The result-<lb/>ing metal positions are schematically shown in Fig. 2. For <lb/>the BisSrsCo402s phase [or 2:2:0:1 (Co), for short], the <lb/>modulation along the a-axis is a fourfold multiplication of <lb/>the subcell parameter. In previously studied compounds, <lb/>the modulation was fivefold, in BiiSr2CuO~[2:2:0:1(Cu)] <lb/>(Ref. 8) and BiiSr3Fe20~[2:3:0:2(Fe)] (Ref. 6), or ap-<lb/>proximately fivefold, in Bi2Sr2CaCuzO~[2:2:1:2(Cu)]. <lb/>&apos; <lb/>The superstructure of the 2:2:0:1 (Co) resembles those of <lb/>2:3:0:2 (Fe) or 2:2:1:2 (Cu) phases more closely than it <lb/>resembles that of its Cu analog, 2:2:0:1 (Cu). The struc-<lb/>ture of the Sr-Co-Sr layers is distorted perovskite, with all <lb/>oxygen atoms present [contrary to the work of Onoda and <lb/>Soto for 2:2:0:1(Cu)], and the Bi-0 layers approximate-<lb/>ly 50% rocksalt type, 50% perovskite type.

Projection down the b axis of the positions of metal <lb/>atoms. The origin is at the bottom left, with the x axis horizon-<lb/>tal, and the z axis vertical. The solid line is the outline of the <lb/>unit ce)l. Two periods are plotted along each direction. The Bi-<lb/>Sr-Co-Sr-Bi slabs are displaced along z, and the amplitude of <lb/>the displacement oscillates sinusoidally along x. The layers are <lb/>also compressed and extended along x, as shown by the varying <lb/>gap between the solid Bi circles. <lb/>gen content corresponds to a Co valence greater than +2, <lb/>again contrary to Ref. 8, which reported a Cu valence <lb/>below +2 in 2:2:0:1(Cu). <lb/>Figure 3(a) shows the displacement along z produced <lb/>by the up-and-down flexing of the slabs. This flexing is al-<lb/>most purely sinusoidal with amplitude 0.5 and 0.3 A for <lb/>the Sr and Bi layers, respectively, but it is more distorted <lb/>for the Co layer, with obvious components from higher <lb/>harmonics. These harmonics stem from the displacement <lb/>of Co atoms toward the regions of the Bi layers where the <lb/>Bi is separated by oxygen in bridging positions (see <lb/>below). In a simple ionic picture of Bi +3 and 0 -2 <lb/>point ions, those regions are more negative than the other <lb/>regions of the Bi-0 layers, where the oxygens are in rock-<lb/>salt positions, and they would be expected to attract p&apos;osi-<lb/>tive Co ions. <lb/>Figure 3(b) shows the associated compression and ex-<lb/>tension of the slabs along the a axis. In the 2:3:0:1(Fe) <lb/>phase, the Sr at the center of the perovskite slab showed <lb/>negligible compression, corresponding to a simple elastic <lb/>model where the center of the slab is at the so-called neu-<lb/>tral plane. Here, however, the Co atoms at the center of <lb/>the plane show some compression. Again, this may be due <lb/>to the negatively charged perovskite regions at the convex <lb/>part of the slabs. <lb/>Figure 4(a) shows the ideal oxygen distribution for <lb/>rocksalt and bridging types. The actual distribution [Fig. <lb/>4(b) l is disordered, and each oxygen site has 50% occu-<lb/>pancy.

Nevertheless, the mechanism of oxygen insertion <lb/>found in 2:3:0:2(Fe) is clearly recognizable here, in spite <lb/>of the disorder; the periodic alternation between the rock-<lb/>salt and the perovskite types allows a ninth oxygen row to <lb/>be inserted for every eight Bi rows. <lb/>To determine the evolution of the structural modulation <lb/>upon increasing the doping content within the Bi2Srz-<lb/>Cu &amp; &quot;M&quot;O» series, transmission-electron-microscopy <lb/>studies were performed. Electron diffraction patterns ob-<lb/>tained with a 0.27-pm selected-area aperture, looking <lb/>down to the c axis, were collected for several samples and <lb/>Fig. 5 displays the most representative ones. In order to <lb/>keep a consistent set of axes throughout for easy compar-<lb/>ison, the intense subcell reflections are indexed with the <lb/>5.4&amp;&amp;5.4&amp;25 A F-centered orthorhombic subcell used for <lb/>example in Ref. 16. In all cases, with the a translation of <lb/>the subcell slightly shorter than b, the modulation occurs <lb/>along a. On the hk0 section, the substructure allows only <lb/>spots with It and k even due to the F centering of the lat-<lb/>tice. In order to index the superstructure reflections, <lb/>which are not the same in all cases, we used a second <lb/>reference system denoted by asterisks. The extra spots <lb/>due to the structure modulation along the a axis are la-<lb/>beled with h k0. For Bi2Sr2Co0~[pattern (d)l, in agree-<lb/>ment with the above x-ray single-crystal work the struc-<lb/>tural modulation is commensurate <lb/>with multiplicity 4. <lb/></body>

Temperature dependence of the susceptibility for <lb/>several members of the Bi2Sr2Cul -Co~0&quot;series. The data <lb/>were collected on warming the samples in a field of 500 G. <lb/>The superconducting <lb/>properties of the Co-and Fe-<lb/>doped Bi2Sr2Cu~-M&quot;O~samples were investigated using <lb/>an ac mutual inductance apparatus. None of the doped <lb/>samples were superconducting <lb/>down to below 4.2 K in <lb/>contrast to the undoped material which shows a T, of 10 <lb/>K. <lb/>The magnetic susceptibility measurements were per-<lb/>formed for several members of the Bi2Sr2Cu~&quot;Co&quot;Os <lb/>eries over the temperature range 4.2-300 K. At low Co <lb/>concentrations, the temperature dependence was Curie <lb/>type over the entire temperature range (data not shown). <lb/>For x 0.5, a Curie temperature dependence is only <lb/>obeyed above 100 K (Fig. 6), and at higher concentra-<lb/>tions, the susceptibility develops a cusp, suggesting an an-<lb/>tiferromagnetic ordering. With increasing Co content, the <lb/>amplitude of this cusp increases and the temperature at <lb/>which it occurs (Tv ) shifts only slightly to lower tempera-<lb/>ture; for Bi2Sr2CoO» (x 1), TN 150 K. Well above <lb/>T~, the susceptibility can be 6t to a Curie-%&apos;eiss law of <lb/>general formula gg Cg(T+e~)+go where Cg, e~, and <lb/>go are the Curie constant, the paramagnetic Curie tem-<lb/>perature, and the temperature-independent <lb/>susceptibility, <lb/>respectively (Fig. 7). Fits over the range of temperature <lb/>250-400 K and 300-400 K led, respectively, to the follow-<lb/>ing parameters p,a 2. 4ptt, e~-130 K, and a root-<lb/>mean-square deviation from the Curie-Weiss law (sigma) <lb/>of 0.2% and p,a 3.01ptt, e~-78, , cr 0.1%. Caution <lb/>Temperature (K) <lb/>FIG. 7. The variation of the susceptibility from 4.2 to 400 K <lb/>in a field of 1 kG is shown for a Bi2SrqCoO~sample. Crosses <lb/>refer to the data points. The solid line is a fit of the data to a <lb/>Curie-Weiss law with the parameters given in the text. Also <lb/>shown is the 1/g vs temperature plot from which the eff&apos;ective <lb/>magnetic momentum per Co atom and the paramagnetic Curie <lb/>temperature, reported in the text, were deduced. <lb/>should be exercised in interpreting these results, as the <lb/>lack of data above 400 K makes the values of p,tr underes-<lb/>timated. If there is 2D behavior as in La2Cu04, where an <lb/>upturn of the susceptibility (due to short-range antiferro-<lb/>magnetic order within the Cu02 planes) was observed <lb/>below 1000 K, &apos; the values of e~c an be meaningless. In <lb/>both cases, however, the values of -e~a re positive, indi-<lb/>cating (within the range of temperature investigated) the <lb/>presence of ferromagnetic interactions. <lb/>The eA&apos;ective <lb/>magnetic moment of 3.01@8 found for Co is smaller than <lb/>that expected (3.9) for high-spin Co + (S 2 ) or (4.9) <lb/>for Co3+ high-spin (S 2) and greater than that expected <lb/>(1.7) for low-spin Co + (S -, &apos; ) or (0) for low-spin Co + <lb/>(S 0). Thus, the valence of Co cannot be simply deter-<lb/>mined from magnetic measurements. <lb/>Magnetic transitions are usually sensitive to changes in <lb/>compositions, which can be caused by changes in process-<lb/>ing. This is also true for the BiqSr2CoO~phase. A sample <lb/>processed in air at T 890 C (denoted A) has a TIv of <lb/>150 K, and by lowering the annealing temperature of the <lb/>sample in air to 840 C, we found that T~moves to higher <lb/>temperatures (up to 270 K). This ordering temperature <lb/>decreases to 100 K when the compound is treated at <lb/>800&apos;C under argon (Fig. 8). When such a sample is an-<lb/>nealed under oxygen, as reported in the experimental sec-<lb/>tion, another phase forms that has no magnetic order so <lb/>that the magnetic transition vanishes (Fig. 8). Such a <lb/>large dependence of the magnetic ordering temperature <lb/>on stoichiometry also occurs for other perovskites, such as <lb/>La2Cu04, &apos; &apos; La2Ni04, <lb/>or YBa2Cu30$. <lb/>For <lb/>both La2Cu04 and YBa2Cu30s, however, Tlv is shifted to <lb/>lo~er temperatures with increasing oxygen content, the <lb/>opposite of what we observe here. We also found that the <lb/>antiferromagnetic ordering temperature in Bi2Sr2CoO~is <lb/>lowered if the materials are made with cobalt deficiency, <lb/>indicating again that there is a close correlation between <lb/>composition and magnetic properties for this compound. <lb/></body>

Figure 10 shows the susceptibility <lb/>(uncorrected for demagnetization) <lb/>for several rectangu-<lb/>larlike crystals (of overall weight 2.6 mg and of overall di-<lb/>mensions 4X 1 X0.1 mm ), with the applied field parallel <lb/>to the a, b, and c crystallographic directions. When the <lb/>applied field is parallel to a, clear evidence for antifer-<lb/>romagnetism is observed at T~= 150 K. But, in addition <lb/>a well-defined peak of lower amplitude [which is barely <lb/>detectable when the measurements are performed on bulk <lb/>(see, for instance, inset of Fig. 9)) shows up at T 100 K. <lb/>This peak may be either due to impurities or is intrinsic to <lb/>the compound. <lb/>For instance, two magnetic transitions <lb/>were found within the layered LaqCo04.~Experiments <lb/>are in progress to determine the origin of this peak, and <lb/>we will not comment any further. However, a rather <lb/>striking feature of Fig. 10 is the large difference in the <lb/>amplitude of the susceptibility both above and below TJv, <lb/>depending on the orientation of the applied field.

Resistivi-<lb/>ty measurements on a Bi2Sr2CoO» lamellarlike aggregate <lb/>(consisting of several plateletlike crystals) from the same <lb/>batch as used for magnetic measurements is shown in Fig. <lb/>10(a). The resistivity increases with decreasing tempera-<lb/>ture indicative of a semiconducting or insulating regime. <lb/>Note a change in the rate at which the resistivity increases <lb/>at T 180~10 K. It is interesting to note that it is over <lb/>the same temperature range that a magnetic transition is <lb/>observed suggesting that both are related. We should <lb/>point out that similar measurements made on sintered pel-<lb/>lets gave greater values for the resistivity at room temper-<lb/>ature (on the order of 20 0 cm instead of I for the crys-<lb/>tal), and also no anomalies in the temperature-depen-<lb/>dence resistivity curve were observed, even though the <lb/>same sample shows a magnetic transition. <lb/>Such dif-<lb/>ferences may be due to grain boundaries and/or inhomo-<lb/>geneities problems, always greater in bulk than in crystals. <lb/>To further investigate the magnetic anomaly observed <lb/>in the susceptibility, neutron diffraction was performed on <lb/>a powder sample. This sample was prepared in air at <lb/>840 C in contrast to 890&apos;C for the previous sample <lb/>denoted A, thus explaining the difference in Tiv between <lb/>both samples. Here we briefly present some of the results; <lb/>more details will be published elsewhere. 6 Various anti-<lb/>ferromagnetic refiections of the type IOL were observed at <lb/>low temperature. This cell indexing refers to the subcell <lb/>of dimensions 5.459 &amp;&amp; 5.462 x 23.45 A. , where the a axis is <lb/>one-quarter of that in the modulated structure. Figure 11 <lb/>shows the temperature dependence of the (102) magnetic <lb/>peak which exhibits a Neel temperature of T~270 K, in <lb/>agreement with the susceptibility (measured on the same <lb/>sample) shown in the inset. The intensity does not fall <lb/>abruptly to zero at T&amp;. This smearing of T~may be due <lb/>to critical scattering or to inhomogeneities in the sample, <lb/>because, as already noted, Tz is sensitive to composition <lb/>changes. From the observed magnetic intensities, the spin <lb/>structure (Fig. 11, inset) has spins lying in the plane per-<lb/>pendicular to c, in agreement with the susceptibility data. <lb/>The spins point perpendicular to the direction of the anti-<lb/>ferromagnetic wave vector, z, which is along either the a <lb/>or b axis. The difference between a and b cannot be <lb/>resolved directly from the subcell peaks due to the near <lb/>tetragonality of the substructure. However, because of <lb/>the structural modulation, we also observe superlattice <lb/>refiections which are purely magnetic in character. From <lb/>these, we can conclude <lb/>that the spins point along the b <lb/>axis, perpendicular to the structural modulation direction. <lb/>We have also studied the magnetic properties of Bi2-<lb/>Sr2Cu~-&quot;Fe&quot;O», which turns out to be simpler than for <lb/>the Co series. For the undoped material the susceptibility <lb/>is temperature independent. <lb/>As Cu is replaced by Fe a <lb/>Curie-Weiss behavior develops. No anomalies are ob-<lb/>served in the curves of g vs T [Fig. 12(a)], suggesting that <lb/>there are no magnetic transitions. Over the range of tem-<lb/>perature 200-350 K the data can be successfully fitted to <lb/>a Curie-Weiss law as described above, giving an effective <lb/>magnetic moment p,g 5.13pg per Fe atom. <lb/>From this moment, it is again impossible to unambigu-<lb/>ously ascribe a valence to Fe. Thus, the Fe Mossbauer <lb/>effect was used to study the electronic valence state of Fe <lb/>and the local structure in Bi2Sr2Cuo5Feo50». The Fe <lb/>Mossbauer absorption spectrum was obtained in a stan-<lb/>dard transition geometry with a conventional constant ac-<lb/>celeration spectrometer using a Co in Rh source. The <lb/>room-temperature <lb/>Mossbauer spectrum is shown in Fig. <lb/>12(b).

The intensity of the two different quadrupole lines <lb/>are in the ratio 4:3. The lines are broad (full width at half <lb/>maximum equal to 0.50 mm/s), indicating a random dis-<lb/>tribution between Fe and Cu in the same crystallographic <lb/>sites.

The temperature-dependent <lb/>susceptibility (collected <lb/>in a field of 10 kG) for several samples of the BiiSr2eu, --<lb/>Fe&quot;O» series are shown in (a).

Note the clear evidence for two quadrUpole splittings. <lb/>0.65 mm/s for Fei and Fe2, respectively. The correspond-<lb/>ing observed isomer shifts are 0.22 and 0.18 mm/s, indi-<lb/>cating that iron is in the Fe + valence state. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>This study of the Bi2Sr2Cui -, M&quot;O» system has shown <lb/>that there is a subtle and delicate balance between compo-<lb/>sition, structural, and physical properties. The transport <lb/>and magnetic properties of these materials are determined <lb/>by the electronic state of each element in the material. In <lb/>chemical terms, these properties are determined by the <lb/>valence or oxidation state and spin state of each element <lb/>and the nature of the bonding, ionic or covalent; in physi-<lb/>cal terms, they are determined by the nature of the wave <lb/>function at the Fermi level (the degree of hybridization of <lb/>the 3d metal orbitals with oxygen 2p levels, for example). <lb/>The following discussion addresses these properties. In <lb/>some oxides, bismuth can adopt either the valence 3+ or <lb/>5+ or both, as the result of the hybridization of the Bi 6s <lb/>and 0 2p levels. This possibility is ruled out here, since <lb/>x-ray photoemission measurements <lb/>on the Bi cuprate <lb/>phases, either undoped or doped with Co or Fe, have <lb/>shown that Bi is only +3 in these phases. En agreement <lb/>with these measurements, <lb/>band-structure <lb/>calculations <lb/>show that the Bi 6s band is well below the Fermi level and <lb/>the Bi 6p band well above, thereby implying Bi +. Furth-<lb/>ermore, the Bi-0 stereochemistry from the crystal studies <lb/>does not correspond to Bi +. <lb/>The subcell of the new Bi2Sr2CoO» compound is iso-<lb/>structural to that of the 10-K phase. Both compounds <lb/>contain MO2 layers with elongated CuOs or Co06 octahe-<lb/>dra and crystallographically sheared Bi-0 layers. The full <lb/>structure, however, differs because the periodicity of the <lb/>structural modulation is four subcells for Co and five for <lb/>Cu. The structural modulation in Bi2Sr2CoO» is caused <lb/>by the insertion of one extra row of oxygen atoms for <lb/>every eight rows of Bi atoms, as in Bi2Sr3Fe20», where <lb/>one extra row of oxygen is inserted in every ten rows of Bi. <lb/>As a result, the oxygen content for Bi2Sr2CoO», which <lb/>would be 24 if the Bi slabs were 100% rocksalt structure, <lb/>is increased to 25, or one extra oxygen for every four Co <lb/>atoms. A simple valence count (assuming Bi + and Sr +) <lb/>gives the formal valence of Co as 2.50 (50% of Co + and <lb/>50% of Co +). Within the Cu phase where the structural <lb/>modulation is five, there should be (according to our mod-<lb/>el ) an extra oxygen for every five Cu atoms, leading to a <lb/>formal valence of Cu of 2.4, compared to 2.2 obtained <lb/>from chemical analysis. <lb/>In Bi2Sr2CuO», the Cu 3d levels <lb/>mix with oxygen 2p levels so that the electrons collectively <lb/>give rise to both metallic behavior and to temperature-<lb/>independent susceptibility [Fig. 12(a)]. In moving to the <lb/>left of Cu in the Periodic Table, the energy difference be-<lb/>tween the metal 3d levels and oxygen 2p levels increases <lb/>so that the orbital overlap decreases, resulting in a locali-<lb/>zation of the d-like electrons and producing an insulator. <lb/>This applies to the BiqSrqCoO» phase (Co left of Cu in the <lb/>Periodic Table), since both insulating and paramagnetic <lb/>behavior are observed. However, Co has a mixed valence, <lb/>and in a localized electron regime, one normally expects <lb/>two diA&apos;erent sites or environments for Co, as in Co304. It <lb/>is suggestive that for two of the four Co in the structure of <lb/>Bi2Sr2CoO» (Co-1 and Co-4 in Table III), the Co is shift-<lb/>ed toward one of the two apical oxygens on the distorted <lb/>CoOs octahedron, so that this Co-0 distance is almost as <lb/>short as the four Co-0 distances to the four equatorial ox-<lb/>ygens. Thus, two of the Co atoms are nearly fivefold coor-<lb/>dinated, while the other two are fourfold coordinated, in-<lb/>dicating that two different sites for Co exist within the <lb/>structure. <lb/>(Two different sites are also seen in the <lb/>Mossbauer results for the Bi2Sr2Cuo 5Feo 50» compound. ) <lb/>Thus, with two structural Co sites, the insulating behavior <lb/>of Bi2Sr2CoO» in which Co has the formal valence 2.5 is <lb/>not so surprising. In this compound, a formal valence of <lb/>Co below +3 is also consistent with the fact that <lb/>Bi2Sr2CoO» must be synthesized in a reducing atmo-<lb/>sphere, not an oxidizing one. A reducing atmosphere <lb/>might be expected to favor Co + whereas an oxidizing at-<lb/>mosphere stabihzes the n =2 phase, in which, by analogy <lb/>to the Fe compound, the valence of Co is probably +3. <lb/>Now we consider the lattice parameters for the Fe-and <lb/>Co-doped BiqSr2Cui &quot;M&quot;O» series. In both series, the <lb/>unit-cell volume does not change continuously, but drops <lb/>sharply from 705 to 699 A&apos;, at x =0.25 for Fe and x 0.5 <lb/>for Co. Lattice instabilities or changes in the electronic <lb/>state or spin configuration of the 3d metal ions generally <lb/>account for such sharp changes in unit-cell volume. For <lb/></body>

			<body>instance, increasing the oxidation state of an ion or chang-<lb/>ing its spin configuration from high spin (HS) to low spin <lb/>(LS) reduces its ionic radius and thereby the unit-cell <lb/>volume of the compound containing this ion. On the other <lb/>hand, sudden changes in the electronic state of the 3d <lb/>metal ions should produce equally drastic changes in the <lb/>effective magnetic moment per 3d metal ion, and such <lb/>changes in the moment per Co or Fe were not observed for <lb/>either the Co or Fe series. It is more likely, therefore, that <lb/>lattice instabilities cause the sharp drops in Fig. 1. These <lb/>instabilities <lb/>may simply be related to the observed <lb/>structural change (monoclinic-orthorhombic) <lb/>associated <lb/>with the sudden change in the periodicity of the structural <lb/>modulation from 5 to 4 observed in going from the Cu to <lb/>the Co system, thereby suggesting a noncontinuous <lb/>change of the modulation. Among the Bi compounds, the <lb/>structural modulation determines the oxygen content and <lb/>thereby the valence of the 3d metal. Moreover, we have <lb/>shown that Fe enters the structure as a + 3 ion whereas <lb/>Co has an average valence of 2.5 in the fully-doped com-<lb/>pound. Thus if the structural modulation occurs at some <lb/>specific valence of M, it should occur at a value of x half <lb/>as large in the Fe series as in the Co series, as observed. <lb/>We turn now to the magnetism in Bi2Sr2CoO». We <lb/>found for this phase a 3D antiferromagnetic transition <lb/>which, depending on the stoichiometry and processing of <lb/>the samples, occurs over a range of temperature from <lb/>100-280 K. Within the CoOq planes, the CoOs elongated <lb/>octahedra share corners, so that superexchange Co-0-Co <lb/>interactions rather than direct Co-Co exchange interac-<lb/>tions probably determine the magnetic interactions. Thus, <lb/>one would expect the magnetic transition to be sensitive to <lb/>stoichiometry of oxygen or cobalt, as we observe experi-<lb/>mentally. <lb/>The sharpness of the susceptibility peak at the Neel <lb/>temperature is suggestive of a ferromagnetic component <lb/>among the magnetic interactions. This is also supported <lb/>by the field-dependent magnetization curves collected at <lb/>constant temperature below Tlv which show a step at a <lb/>critical field denoted H, . For applied fields greater than <lb/>H, and up to 5 T we did not reach a saturation in magne-<lb/>tization. A similar behavior was observed for La2Cu04. &quot; <lb/>It was ascribed to a fiip of the small component of the Cu <lb/>spins normal to the Cu02 layers. <lb/>&apos; However, the peak <lb/>in susceptibility was seen for fields normal to the plane, <lb/>whereas here it is largest for fields in the plane, suggesting <lb/>that the canted component of the spins lies in the plane in <lb/>our case. A comparison of the field-induced magnetiza-<lb/>tion data for La2Cu04 (see figure in Ref. 24) with that of <lb/>Fig. 9 for Bi2Sr2CoO» indicates that in both materials <lb/>the field-induced antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic <lb/>(AF-<lb/>F) transition occurs at the same field (3-4 T), and that <lb/>the amplitude of this transition when reported in pg per <lb/>Co atom is of the same order, leading to the belief that the <lb/>energy required for the transition is similar in both ma-<lb/>terials. For La the canting is out of the plane in contrast <lb/>to in the plane with Bi phase (i.e. , for La the AF-F transi-<lb/>tion involves a reorientation of a small ferromagnetic mo-<lb/>ment in alternate sheets, whereas in the Bi compound ac-<lb/>cording to our results it involves a reorientation of a small <lb/>ferromagnetic moment within the Co02 layer). Usually <lb/>one expects the interlayer coupling to be much weaker <lb/>than the intralayer coupling. Our results do not seem to <lb/>support this point. At present we cannot qualitatively ex-<lb/>plain such a difference which may be related to the cant-<lb/>ing transition (i.e. , symmetry of the spin system) which is <lb/>more complicated, due to the structural modulation, for <lb/>the Co phase than for the La2Cu04 compound. Also, it <lb/>turns out that there are four different Co atoms in the su-<lb/>perstructure, and perhaps not all of them are canted in the <lb/>same way. <lb/>In addition to this metamagnetic behavior, the elastic <lb/>neutron-scattering <lb/>data shows that the spin structure of <lb/>Bi2Sr2CoO» is similar to La2Cu04, since the antiferro-<lb/>magnetic wave vector and the spin direction are perpen-<lb/>dicular, with the spins pointing along the I» axis. Alterna-<lb/>tively, the anisotropy in the susceptibility above T~sug-<lb/>gests XYor Ising behavior as in La2Co04. Thus, further <lb/>neutron-scattering <lb/>experiments on single crystals would <lb/>be useful to look for 2D correlations above T~and to <lb/>study the inelasticity of the scattering. <lb/>In summary, we have reported the synthesis of new Bi-<lb/>based phases Bi2Sr2Cu~&quot;M0» (M =Fe, Co) which <lb/>have .similar structure to the IO-K superconducting <lb/>Bi2Sr2CuO» phase. The substitution of Cu by Co reduces <lb/>the structure modulation (caused by the uptake of an oxy-<lb/>gen atom every ten or eight Bi rows) from 5 to 4. But <lb/>based on the study of Fe and Co solid solutions, it appears <lb/>that this structural transition is discontinuous. This might <lb/>account for the difficultie encountered in removing oxy-<lb/>gen from these materials. The fully doped Co material <lb/>(Bi2Sr2CoO») is an antiferromagnetic <lb/>insulator with a <lb/>Neel temperature sensitive to deviation from stoichio-<lb/>metry and with a magnetic phase transition suggesting Is-<lb/>ing critical behavior. However, further work remains to <lb/>be done in order to determine the origin of the metamag-<lb/>netic state in this compound and to better understand the <lb/>role of the structural modulation on the magnetic proper-<lb/>ties. <lb/></body>
