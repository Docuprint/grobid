	<front>ABSTRACT <lb/>By virtue of the itinerant electron metamagnetism (IEM), the RCo 2 compounds with <lb/>R=Er, Ho and Dy are found to show first order magnetic transition at their ordering <lb/>temperatures. The inherent instability of Co sublattice magnetism is responsible for the <lb/>occurrence of IEM, which leads to interesting magnetic and related properties. The <lb/>systematic studies of the variations in the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of the <lb/>RCo 2 -based compounds show that the magnetovolume effect plays a decisive role in <lb/>determining the nature of magnetic transitions and hence the magnetocaloric effect <lb/>(MCE) in these compound. It is found that the spin fluctuations arising due to the <lb/>magnetovolume effect reduce the strength of IEM in these compounds, which <lb/>subsequently lead to a reduction in the MCE. Most of the substitutions at the Co site are <lb/>found to result in a positive magnetovolume effect, leading to an initial increase in the <lb/>ordering temperature. Application of pressure, on the other hand, causes a reduction in <lb/>the ordering temperature due to the negative magnetovolume effect. A comparative <lb/>study of the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of RCo 2 compounds under various <lb/>substitutions and applied pressure is presented. Analysis of the magnetization data using <lb/>the Landau theory has shown that there is a strong correlation between the Landau <lb/>coefficient (B) and the MCE. The variations seen in the order of magnetic transition and <lb/>the MCE values seem to support the recent model proposed by Khmelevskyi and Mohn <lb/>for the occurrence of IEM in RCo 2 compounds. <lb/></front>

			<body>1. <lb/>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Twenty first century saw the emergence of magnetism and magnetic materials as major <lb/>fields of activity which have got profound influence in the industry and day-today life of <lb/>human beings. Magnetic materials play an integral part in applications such as permanent <lb/>magnets, memory devices, transducers etc [1]. A relatively new entrant to this list is the <lb/>magnetic refrigeration. Magnetic materials are the active materials for a magnetic <lb/>refrigerator [2, 3]. The use of a magnetic material as a refrigerant in a magnetic <lb/>refrigerator relies on its magnetocaloric behavior. Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is <lb/>defined as the cooling or heating of a magnetic material when it is subjected to a varying <lb/>magnetic field. This magneto-thermal phenomenon was first discovered by Warburg in <lb/>1881 [4]. Warburg found that iron got heated up when placed in a magnetic field and <lb/>when the magnetic field was removed the iron sample cooled down. The origin of MCE <lb/>was explained independently by Debye and Giauque [5, 6]. They also suggested the first <lb/>practical use of the MCE: the adiabatic demagnetization used to reach temperatures lower <lb/>than that of liquid helium, which had been the lowest achievable experimental <lb/>temperature. Nowadays, there is a great deal of interest in using the magnetic <lb/>refrigeration as an alternative refrigeration technology, from room temperature to the <lb/>cryogenic temperature regime [2, 7]. The magnetic refrigeration offers the prospect of an <lb/>energy-efficient and environment-friendly alternative to the commonly used vapor-cycle <lb/>refrigeration technology in use today. Furthermore, this technology is purely solid state <lb/>based and has the advantage that the engineering design remains unaltered even when the <lb/>refrigerant is changed to suit different operating temperatures. Efforts are on to fabricate <lb/>magnetic refrigerators for house-hold, industrial and technological applications. <lb/>Fig. 1 Schematic S-T plots of a ferromagnetic material illustrating the existence of <lb/>magnetocaloric effect. The solid lines represent the total entropy in two different <lb/>magnetic fields: H 0 and H 1 (H 1 &gt; H 0 ). The horizontal and the vertical arrows show <lb/>adiabatic temperature change (∆T ad ) and the isothermal magnetic entropy change (∆S M ), <lb/>respectively, when the magnetic field is changed from H 0 to H 1 . <lb/>2. <lb/>MAGNETOCALORIC EFFECT AND MAGNETIC REFRIGERATON <lb/>The main challenges in the realization of a practical refrigerator are (i) the availability of <lb/>bulk amounts of giant magnetocaloric materials (ii) proper magnetic field design, <lb/>preferably with a permanent magnet array and (iii) ingenious design. Since most of the <lb/>materials developed so far show giant magnetocaloric effect (GMCE) only at fields as <lb/>high as 50 kOe, there is an urgent need to look for more potential materials so that the <lb/>same MCE could be obtained with lower fields. In this context, materials which show <lb/>first order magnetic transitions, metamagnetic transitions or magneto-structural <lb/>transitions are being probed. <lb/>The MCE is intrinsic to all magnetic materials and is induced via the coupling of <lb/>magnetic sublattice with the applied magnetic field and is measured as adiabatic <lb/>temperature change (∆T ad ) or isothermal entropy change (∆S M ). The isothermal <lb/>magnetization of a paramagnet or a soft ferromagnet reduces the entropy and, in a <lb/>reversible process, demagnetization (which is similar to the expansion of a gas) restores <lb/>the zero-field magnetic entropy of the system. Since in an adiabatic process the total <lb/>entropy of a material remains constant, the adiabatic demagnetization of a ferromagnetic <lb/>material leads to reduction in the temperature. <lb/>The value of the total entropy (S) of a ferromagnet at constant pressure depends on both <lb/>the magnetic field (H) and temperature (T) and the contribution to it arises from the <lb/>lattice (S lat ), electronic (S el ) and the magnetic (S M ) entropies, <lb/>( ) <lb/>( ) <lb/>( ) <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>H <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>H <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>el <lb/>L <lb/>M <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>, <lb/>, <lb/>(1) <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 1 schematically shows the S vs T plots of a ferromagnet in two different fields H 0 <lb/>and H 1 (H 1 &gt;H 0 ). In order to understand the thermodynamics of MCE, two relevant <lb/>processes are shown in the Fig. 1: <lb/>(i) When the magnetic field is applied adiabatically in a reversible process, the magnetic <lb/>entropy decreases, but as the total entropy does not change, i.e., <lb/>( <lb/>) ( <lb/>) <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>, <lb/>, <lb/>H <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>H <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>= <lb/>(2) <lb/>it leads to an increase in the temperature of the material. The adiabatic temperature <lb/>change (∆T ad ), i.e. the difference between the initial temperature T 0 and the final <lb/>temperature T 1 , can be visualized as the isentropic difference between the corresponding <lb/>S(T,H) functions and it is a measure of the MCE of the material. <lb/>(ii) When the magnetic field is applied isothermally (i.e. keeping T constant), the total <lb/>entropy decreases due to the increase in the magnetic order. The isothermal magnetic <lb/>entropy change (∆S M ) in the process is defined as <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>, <lb/>) <lb/>, <lb/>( <lb/>H <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>H <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>S M <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>∆ <lb/>(3) <lb/>Therefore, it can be seen that ∆T ad and ∆S M represent the two quantities which are <lb/>characteristic of MCE. It is obvious from Fig. 1 that both ∆T ad and ∆S M are functions of <lb/>the initial temperature T 0 and the magnetic field change ∆H=H 1 -H 0 . Furthermore, it is <lb/>easy to see from the figure that if raising the magnetic field increases the magnetic order, <lb/>∆T ad is positive and the magnetic material heats up (∆S M is negative). The signs of ∆T ad <lb/>and ∆S M are correspondingly reversed when the magnetic field is reduced. <lb/>The MCE parameters viz. ∆T ad and ∆S M are correlated with the magnetization (M), the <lb/>magnetic field strength, the heat capacity (C) and the absolute temperature by one of the <lb/>fundamental Maxwell&apos;s relations [2]. <lb/>( ) <lb/>( ) <lb/>H <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>H <lb/>T <lb/>M <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>⎟ <lb/>⎠ <lb/>⎞ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎝ <lb/>⎛ <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂ <lb/>= <lb/>⎟ <lb/>⎠ <lb/>⎞ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎝ <lb/>⎛ <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂ <lb/>, <lb/>, <lb/>(4) <lb/>For an isothermal-isobaric process the integration of the above equation yields <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( ) <lb/>. <lb/>, <lb/>, <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>∫ <lb/>⎟ <lb/>⎠ <lb/>⎞ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎝ <lb/>⎛ <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂ <lb/>= <lb/>∆ <lb/>∆ <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>M <lb/>dH <lb/>T <lb/>H <lb/>T <lb/>M <lb/>H <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>(5) <lb/>Equation 5 indicates that the magnetic entropy change is proportional to the temperature <lb/>derivative of magnetization at constant field. By combining the equation 4 with the <lb/>corresponding TdS equation, it can be shown that the infinitesimal adiabatic temperature <lb/>rise for the reversible adiabatic-isobaric process is equal to <lb/></body>

Furthermore, the behavior of the <lb/>∆T ad and <lb/>( ) H <lb/>M T <lb/>S <lb/>∆ <lb/>∆ <lb/>should be similar and they will gradually be reduced on both sides <lb/>of the T C . <lb/>(iii) For the same value <lb/>( ) H <lb/>M T <lb/>S <lb/>∆ <lb/>∆ <lb/>, the ∆T ad will be larger at higher absolute <lb/>temperature, and also when the total heat capacity of the solid is lower. Furthermore, at <lb/>elevated temperatures, due to large value of the total heat capacity, considerable ∆T ad can <lb/>be observed only when ( <lb/>) H <lb/>T <lb/>M ∂ <lb/>∂ / <lb/>becomes significant. <lb/>From the above discussion, it is clear that the MCE is significant only close to a magnetic <lb/>transition temperature. As a consequence, in general ferro-para magnetic transitions will <lb/>show the maximum entropy change. Therefore, the first and foremost attempt in the <lb/>design of a magnetic refrigerator is to identify a suitable magnetic material which shows <lb/>a magnetic transition near the operating temperature of the refrigerator. Since the MCE <lb/>depends on the sharpness of the transition, materials with first order magnetic transitions <lb/>are preferred. Another alternative is to use materials which undergo magnetic field-<lb/>induced structural transitions. The entropy change associated with the structural changes <lb/>would enhance the magnetic entropy change and hence a large MCE is expected. <lb/>Therefore, from the point of view of refrigeration applications, one looks for materials <lb/>which exhibit giant magnetocaloric effect. However, when put into the application, there <lb/>will always be a drift in the operating temperature and therefore, the refrigerant system <lb/>should contribute considerable MCE over a span of temperature around the operating <lb/>temperature. This can be achieved by making a composite magnetic material which <lb/>contains many materials whose magnetic transition temperatures are spread over a span <lb/>around the operating temperature. Other possibility is to have a material which shows <lb/>close-by multiple magnetic transitions. In both these cases, a &apos;table-like&apos; (flat) MCE vs. T <lb/>plot is expected. However, due to the lack of materials with sharp multiple transitions, <lb/></body>

			<body>emphasis is given to the first choice, i.e., to tune the magnetic transition of the parent <lb/>system with the help of substitutions so that a graded magnetic material is produced. But, <lb/>substitutions generally reduce the MCE and therefore, a compromise has to be reached so <lb/>as to get a reasonable MCE spread over a range of temperature or a &apos;table-like&apos; MCE. <lb/>2. 1 <lb/>MEASUREMENT OF MCE USING INDIRECT METHODS <lb/>Unlike direct measurement, which usually yields only the adiabatic temperature change, <lb/>indirect method using the heat capacity data at different applied fields allow the <lb/>calculation of both ∆Tad(T, ∆H) and ∆S M (T, ∆H). On the other hand, the calculation using <lb/>magnetization measurements yields only ∆S M (T, ∆H). In the latter case, magnetization <lb/>must be measured as a function of T and H. This allows to obtain ∆S M (T, ∆H) by <lb/>numerical integration using equation. 5, and it is a very useful tool in the rapid search for <lb/>potential magnetic refrigerant materials [2, 9, 10]. The accuracy of ∆S M (T,∆H) calculated <lb/>from magnetization data depends on the accuracy of the measurements of the magnetic <lb/>moment, T and H. It is also affected by the fact that the exact differentials in equation 5 <lb/>(dM, dH and dT) are replaced by the measured variations (dM, dT and dH). Taking into <lb/>account all these effects, the error in the value of ∆S M (T, ∆H) lies within the range of 3-<lb/>10% [2, 10]. The measurement of the heat capacity as a function of temperature in <lb/>constant magnetic fields and pressure, C(T)P,H, provides the most complete <lb/>characterization of MCE in magnetic materials. The entropy of a solid can be calculated <lb/>from the heat capacity as: <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>H <lb/>T <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>S <lb/>dT <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>C <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>+ <lb/>= ∫ <lb/>(8) <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>, <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>H <lb/>T <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>S <lb/>dT <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>C <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>+ <lb/>= ∫ <lb/>(9) <lb/>where <lb/>0 <lb/>H <lb/>S and <lb/>1 <lb/>H <lb/>S are the zero temperature entropies. In a condensed system <lb/>0 <lb/>H <lb/>S = <lb/>1 <lb/>H <lb/>S <lb/>[11]. Hence, if S(T)H is known, both ∆Tad(T, ∆H) and ∆S M (T, ∆H) can be obtained [10] <lb/>with he help of the following equations (see Fig. 1): <lb/>S <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>ad <lb/>S <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>] <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>[ <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>0 <lb/>1 − <lb/>≅ <lb/>∆ <lb/>∆ <lb/>(10) <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>M <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>T <lb/>S <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>∆ <lb/>∆ <lb/>(11) <lb/>On the basis of the magnetocaloric properties of a number of compounds, Pecharsky and <lb/>Gschneidner have shown that the determination of MCE using the indirect methods are <lb/>reliable and compares well with those determined from the direct measurement [12]. <lb/>2.2 <lb/>POTENTIAL MAGNETOCALORIC MATERIALS FOR VARIOUS <lb/>TEMPERATURE REGIMES <lb/>The magnetocaloric effect can be exploited for cooling applications in various <lb/>temperature regimes, the oldest being the adiabatic demagnetization which was used to <lb/>achieve the temperatures below 1 K with the help of paramagnetic salts such as <lb/></body>

			<body>Gd 2 (SO 4 ) 3 .8H 2 O [13]. Apart from the paramagnetic salts, the paramagnetic alloys like <lb/>PrNi 5 has also been used in the adiabatic demagnetization devices [14]. Recent studies on <lb/>the paramagnetic garnets and their nanocomposites have shown that these materials are <lb/>also potential refrigerants in the temperatures regime below 10 K [15]. Due to the low <lb/>value of ( <lb/>) H <lb/>T <lb/>M ∂ <lb/>∂ / <lb/>, the paramagnetic salts yield small ∆T ad and hence are not suitable <lb/>refrigerants for the temperatures above 10 K. For this temperature range, magnetically <lb/>ordered materials have to be used. Because of the presence of the magnetic correlations, <lb/>the magnetically ordered materials undergo an order-disorder transition in a narrow <lb/>temperature intervals and therefore yield large value of ( <lb/>) H <lb/>T <lb/>M ∂ <lb/>∂ / <lb/>,which in turn leads <lb/>to considerable MCE. It has been reported that pure rare earth metals such as Pr, Nd, Er <lb/>and Tb exhibit considerable MCE below 60 K [2]. However, the investigations regarding <lb/>the MCE of various rare earth alloys and intermetallic compounds suggest that they are <lb/>better refrigerants than the pure rare earths. Among them, the best for the range of 10-80 <lb/>K are RAl 2 , Dy 0.5 Ho 0.5 , Dy x Er 1-x [0&lt;x&lt;1], RNiAl and RNi 2 compounds [2, 16-18]. For <lb/>temperatures above 80 K, the promising refrigerants are Dy metal and Gd 5 (Si , Ge) 4 alloys <lb/>[19]. However, near room temperature, the prototype material is pure Gd [2]. Most of the <lb/>intermetallic compounds which order near room temperature show significantly lower <lb/>MCE as compared to that of Gd metal [20]. The only system in which the MCE is equal <lb/>to that of Gd is Gd 5 (Si,Ge) 4 . Apart from the rare earth based intermetallic compounds, a <lb/>few transition metal based compounds are also known to exhibit considerable MCE near <lb/>room temperature. The best among them are MnFeP 1-x As x , Mn(As,Sb) [3, 21, 22]. <lb/>3 <lb/>MAGNETISM OF RCo 2 COMPOUNDS AND ITS IMPORTANCE IN <lb/>MAGNETOCALORIC EFFECT <lb/>Rare earth (R) -transition metal (TM) intermetallics formed between different rare earths <lb/>and TM=Fe, Co, Ni crystallize in the cubic structure with MgCu 2 -type structure [23]. <lb/>They also form with nonmagnetic elements such as Al, Ga, Si, Ge etc. The magnetic <lb/>ordering temperatures of RFe 2 compounds being much above the room temperature, from <lb/>the point of view of magnetic refrigeration application, they are not considered. On the <lb/>other hand the compounds based on Co and Ni have their ordering temperatures below <lb/>room temperature and has attracted several studies. The tunability of the magnetic <lb/>ordering temperature of these compounds over a wide span with the help of substitutions <lb/>at the Co/Ni site, without changes in the crystal structure, has prompted many researchers <lb/>to carry out detailed magnetic and other related investigations [24-30]. <lb/>Fig. 2 Schematic diagram showing the magnetic state of TM sublattices in RTM 2 <lb/>compounds. <lb/>RTM 2 <lb/>TM= Co <lb/>(On the verge of magnetism) <lb/>TM= Ni <lb/>(Nonmagnetic) <lb/>TM= Fe <lb/>(Magnetic) <lb/></body>

			<body>Though RTM 2 [TM=Fe, Co and Ni] compounds crystallize in the same structure, there <lb/>are considerable differences in their magnetic properties, especially with regard to the <lb/>TM component [31]. This is due to the peculiar band structure of these compounds [23]. <lb/>The hybridization between the transition metal 3d band and the rare earth 5d (4d) band <lb/>gives rise to interesting magnetic properties in R-TM intermetallic compounds. In R-TM <lb/>intermetallics, for a particular R atom, the change in the number of 3d electrons across <lb/>the TM series leads to considerable effect on the density of state s at the Fermi level <lb/>[N(E F )] and plays a decisive role in determining the magnetic properties. Within the <lb/>RTM 2 series, RFe 2 compounds posses magnetic transition metal sublattice with a <lb/>magnetic moment of 1.5µ B [32]. The complete replacement of Fe by Co gives rise to one <lb/>extra electron per Co atom to the 3d band. In the rigid band picture, the addition of the <lb/>extra electrons leads to the filling of the 3d band, which in turn alters the N(E F ) and gives <lb/>rise to interesting magnetic properties in the RCo 2 compounds. In this series of <lb/>compounds the magnetic state of Co strongly depends on the alloying rare earth and the <lb/>moment varies between 0 and 1 µ B [32]. The variation within the series indicates the <lb/>inherent instability of the magnetic state of Co sublattice. In the RNi 2 compounds two <lb/>extra 3d electrons, as compared to RFe 2 , per Ni atom are added. This further addition of <lb/>the extra electron, as compared to that of RCo 2 compounds, drives the Fermi level to a <lb/>region of low density of states and therefore leads to a permanently nonmagnetic state of <lb/>the 3d sublattice in the RNi 2 compounds. Fig. 2 shows the schematic diagram showing <lb/>the TM magnetic state in RTM 2 compounds. <lb/>Fig. 3 M vs. H isotherms showing the itinerant electron metamagnetism in ErCo 2 <lb/>In RCo 2 compounds, the T C values vary from ~20 K to ~ 400 K. Unlike the case of the <lb/>YFe , the YCo 2 does not exhibit any magnetic ordering and behaves like an exchange <lb/>enhanced Pauli paramagnet [23]. The instability of the magnetic state associated with the <lb/>Co sublattice mentioned earlier in some of the RCo 2 compounds leads to metamagnetic <lb/>transition. The creation of the Co moments by the R molecular field as these samples are <lb/>cooled through their ordering temperatures is responsible for the metamagnetic transition, <lb/></body>

			<body>which is termed as itinerant electron metamagnetism (IEM). Fig.3 shows the M-H <lb/>isotherms illustrating the IEM at temperatures just above T C in ErCo 2 . The IEM in these <lb/>compounds leads to first order transition (FOT) at their ordering temperature and many <lb/>interesting observations regarding their structural, magnetic, thermal and transport <lb/>behavior. Among the RCo 2 compounds, ErCo 2 , HoCo 2 and DyCo 2 are found to show <lb/>FOT while all others show a second order transition (SOT) at their ordering temperature. <lb/>Based on a systematic analysis of the magnetic and electrical resistivity data on <lb/>(Er,Y)Co 2 , Hauser et al. have indeed shown that dilution of Er by Y leads to the <lb/>disappearance of IEM [33]. The IEM in these compounds may also be induced by an <lb/>external magnetic field in a limited temperature range above T C [23]. In most of the <lb/>magnetic materials, the transitions are of second order nature and hence IEM systems <lb/>have received a lot of attention for decades owing to their interest in fundamental <lb/>physics. However, of late they have become natural probes in the search for materials <lb/>with large magnetocaloric effect as well as magnetoresistance, by virtue of the first order <lb/>nature of their magnetic transitions. Other IEM systems such as La(Fe,Si) 13 -based <lb/>systems have also attracted considerable attention from the point of view of MCE <lb/>recently [34]. <lb/>3.1 <lb/>ITINERANT ELECTRON METAMAGNETISM IN RCo 2 COMPOUNDS <lb/>It has been observed that some RCo 2 compounds [R=Er, Ho and Dy] undergo IEM in <lb/>which the Co sublattice changes from a nonmagnetic state to a magnetic state when the <lb/>field acting on the 3d band is larger than a critical value H C [23, 33, 35]. This field-<lb/>induced transition in the 3d sublattice is known as itinerant electron metamagnetism and <lb/>was first theoretically predicted by Wohlfarth and Rhodes in 1962 [36]. Using the Landau <lb/>expansion of the magnetic free energy of the d-electrons as <lb/>MH <lb/>M <lb/>C <lb/>M <lb/>B <lb/>M <lb/>A <lb/>F <lb/>− <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>.......... <lb/>6 <lb/>4 <lb/>2 <lb/>6 <lb/>4 <lb/>2 <lb/>(12) <lb/>The theory led to the following expressions for the first lower order coefficients <lb/>R <lb/>E <lb/>N <lb/>A <lb/>F ) <lb/>( <lb/>4 <lb/>1 <lb/>= <lb/>(13) <lb/>( ) <lb/>( ) <lb/>( ) <lb/>( ) ⎥ <lb/>⎥ <lb/>⎦ <lb/>⎤ <lb/>⎢ <lb/>⎢ <lb/>⎣ <lb/>⎡ <lb/>⎭ <lb/>⎬ <lb/>⎫ <lb/>⎩ <lb/>⎨ <lb/>⎧ <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>2 <lb/>&apos; <lb/>&apos; <lb/>&apos; <lb/>3 <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>3 <lb/>64 <lb/>1 <lb/>F <lb/>F <lb/>F <lb/>F <lb/>F <lb/>E <lb/>N <lb/>E <lb/>N <lb/>E <lb/>N <lb/>E <lb/>N <lb/>E <lb/>N <lb/>B <lb/>(14) <lb/>where <lb/>[ <lb/>] 1 <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>F <lb/>E <lb/>IN <lb/>R <lb/>is the Stoner enhancement factor.

The corresponding magnetization curve is shown in Fig. <lb/>4b.

			<body>contribution. Therefore, it may be noticed from equations 13 &amp; 14 that IEM can occur <lb/>when: (1) A is weakly positive. i. e. when the Stoner criterion for the onset of <lb/>ferromagnetism is almost satisfied, and (2) B is negative, which implies another <lb/>minimum for a non-zero value of M. The later condition requires N&apos;&apos;(E F ) to be large <lb/>enough, which in turn means that the density of states at Fermi level should have strong <lb/>positive curvature. On theoretical grounds, Wohlfarth and Rhodes showed that a <lb/>maximum in the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility is expected due to <lb/>the large positive curvature of the density of states and is characteristic of an IEM system <lb/>[36]. Such a temperature dependence of susceptibility has indeed been observed in a <lb/>number of compounds which exhibit IEM [37]. <lb/>Fig. 4.

In general, the IEM is accompanied with the hysteresis effect (see Fig. 3). <lb/>However there are reports in literature that, even though some materials posses negative <lb/>M 4 coefficient, they do not distinctly exhibit IEM and hence the hysteretic effect. In such <lb/>cases, the presence of IEM and FOT are diagnosed with the help of Arrott&apos;s plots. It has <lb/>been established that the materials with negative M coefficient in the Landau free energy <lb/>expression posses S-shaped Arrott&apos;s plots [38]. To emphasize on the above point, the <lb/>Arrott&apos;s plots for DyCo 2 and TbCo 2 are shown in Figs. 5a &amp;b, respectively. It can be <lb/>clearly seen from these figures that the near T C Arrott&apos;s plots of DyCo 2 , which exhibits <lb/>FOT, are S-shaped whereas those corresponding to TbCo 2 , which is known to possess <lb/>SOT, are linear. <lb/>3.2 ROLE OF MAGNETOVOLUME EFFECT IN RCo 2 -BASED COMPOUNDS <lb/>Considerable effort has been put to understand the mystery behind the changeover of the <lb/>order of magnetic transition from SOT to FOT, as the rare earth is changed in RCo <lb/>compounds. The first true attempt towards understanding the nature of transition in these <lb/>compounds was made by Bloch et al. and later by Inoue and Shimizu [39, 40]. According <lb/>to these authors, the critical parameter that governs the IEM and therefore FOT in these <lb/>compounds is the molecular field or the ordering temperature [39, 40]. However, these <lb/>theories met with only limited success. Recently, Khmelevskyi and Mohn have modified <lb/>these models by incorporating the contributions from the magnetovolume effect and spin <lb/>fluctuations [41]. The most important feature in the modified model is the role of lattice <lb/>parameter in determining the magnetic state of Co and thereby the possibility of IEM and <lb/>FOT. <lb/></body>

On the other hand, if the lattice parameter is less than 7.05 Å, <lb/>they posses nonmagnetic Co 3d sublattice, which is similar to that in YCo 2 . In the <lb/>compounds with the lattice parameters in the range of 7.05 -7.22 Å, the Co sublattice is <lb/>nonmagnetic, but moment can be induced with the help of the molecular field of the rare <lb/>earth or the applied field.

Fig. 6 shows the theoretical prediction of Khmelevskyi and Mohn, regarding <lb/>the order of transition for various RCo 2 compounds.

In view of these observations, there is a great scope for studying the <lb/>structure-magnetic property correlation in RCo 2 compounds under various substitutions, <lb/>which cause lattice parameter variations.

The role <lb/>of the lattice parameter in RCo 2 compounds has been demonstrated by pressure <lb/>dependent studies as well [48-50]. Pressure dependence of magnetic properties in RCo 2 <lb/>compounds have been reported by many authors, who have shown that the negative <lb/>magnetovolume effect produced by the pressure destabilizes the Co magnetic state, <lb/>thereby reducing the T C values.

			<body>Fig. 8 The concentration dependence of lattice parameter and T C in R(Co 1-x Ga x ) 2 <lb/>compounds. [Figure taken from Ref. 47.] <lb/>Effect of substitutions of nonmagnetic elements such as Al, Ga, Ge, In and Si for Co in <lb/>RCo 2 compounds with R=Er, Ho and Dy have been reported by many authors. Table 1 <lb/>shows the highlights of these studies. As is evident from this table, the ordering <lb/>temperature, in general, increases with substitutions. As expected, substitution of Fe also <lb/>causes an increase in T C . The enhancement of T C due to the substitutions other than Fe <lb/>mainly arises from the positive magnetovolume effect. The increase in lattice parameter <lb/>as a result of substitutions (upto a critical concentration) causes local moment formation <lb/>due to the positive magnetovolume effect. These local moments cause an increase in the <lb/>R-Co and Co-Co exchange interactions, giving rise to an enhancement of T C [35]. <lb/>However, above the critical concentration, the nonmagnetic substitution causes a nearly <lb/>uniform distribution of Co moments. At this stage, the increasing trend of T C stops and <lb/>for further increase in the concentration of the substituents, T C starts decreasing. Figures <lb/>8a &amp; b show the variation of the lattice parameter and the T C as a function of Ga <lb/>concentration in R(Co 1-x Ga x ) 2 compounds, respectively. It can be seen from these figures <lb/>that the lattice parameters monotonically increase with Ga concentration in all the <lb/>compounds, but the T C variation is different for different rare earths. While the <lb/>compounds based on Dy show an initial increase in T C , the ones with Nd and Gd show a <lb/>decreasing trend of T C even at very small concentrations of Ga. The behavior of Tb-based <lb/>compounds is almost identical to that of Dy compounds. These variations are very much <lb/>consistent with the predictions of Khmelevskyi and Mohn (see Fig. 6). The prediction <lb/>that TbCo 2 is at the boundary between FOT and SOT is reinforced by the variation of T C <lb/>shown in Fig. 8b. Therefore, the examples of nonmagnetic substituted compounds <lb/>demonstrate the presence of positive magnetovolume effect, in contrast to the negative <lb/>magnetovolume effect arising from the application of pressure. In the case of Fe <lb/>substitution, the T C shows a monotonic increase with Fe concentration, in all the <lb/>compounds. The increase in T C seen in the case of Fe substitution mainly arises from the <lb/>enhanced TM-TM exchange interaction and not from the magnetovolume effect. Han et <lb/>al have reported that in Dy(Co,Fe) 2 systems, the order of transition changes from first <lb/>order to second order upon Fe substitution. [30]. <lb/></body>

[Data taken <lb/>from Ref. 42] <lb/>In view of the opposing effects of nonmagnetic substitutions and applied pressure on the <lb/>magnetovolume effect in RCo 2 compounds, it is of interest to find out the effect of <lb/>pressure on these substituted compounds.

As is evident from this figure, like the parent compounds, <lb/>the application of pressure causes a reduction in T C in the Si substituted compounds as <lb/>well. <lb/>Fig.10 Temperature variation of isothermal magnetic entropy change in Dy(Co 1-x Si x ) 2 <lb/>with x= 0, 0.075 and 0.15] compounds obtained for a field change (∆H) of 50 kOe.

[Data partly taken from Ref. 27] <lb/>4 MAGNETOCALORIC EFFECT IN RCo 2 -BASED COMPOUNDS <lb/>Magnetocaloric effect in terms of isothermal magnetic entropy change as well as <lb/>adiabatic temperature change on RCo 2 compounds with R=Er, Ho and Dy have been <lb/>measured by many authors and the important results are summarized in Table 1. The <lb/>values obtained in parent RCo 2 compounds with Er, Ho and Dy are quite high as <lb/>compared to many other materials [51]. It is of interest to note that, though the theoretical <lb/>magnetic entropy i.e. Rln(2J+1) value for all these three compounds are approximately <lb/>equal, the MCE is the highest in ErCo 2 . As the magnetic entropy tends to saturate around <lb/>T C and as the saturation magnetization of these three compounds are very close, the <lb/>smaller the T C the faster the magnetic entropy saturation. Accordingly, the maximum <lb/>entropy change i.e., <lb/>max <lb/>M <lb/>S <lb/>∆ <lb/>is the highest in the compound with the lowest T C . At this <lb/>point it is of importance to mention that the <lb/>max <lb/>M <lb/>S <lb/>∆ <lb/>value in TbCo 2 has been found to be <lb/>about 6 J kg -1 K -1 [25, 52]. Compared to the MCE of the RCo 2 compounds with SOT, the <lb/>MCE seen in TbCo 2 is high, which once again justifies the prediction of Khmelevskyi <lb/>and Mohn (Fig. 6). <lb/>In order to find the effect of substitutions on MCE, several studies have been devoted to <lb/>measure the MCE of substituted RCo 2 [R=Er, Ho and Dy] compounds [24-30, 35, 42, 43, <lb/>45]. As in the case of other magnetic properties such as ordering temperature, the MCE is <lb/>also found to be very much affected by substitutions. Fig. 10 shows the MCE variation <lb/>observed in Si substituted DyCo 2 . It has been found that the MCE calculated using the C-<lb/>H-T data as well as the M-H-T data yield almost same results. Fig. 11 shows the typical <lb/>heat capacity (C) vs. T plot of Dy(Co 1-x Si x ) 2 compounds. It can be seen that the onset of <lb/>magnetic ordering in DyCo 2 is characterized by huge jump in the C-T plot, however, the <lb/>near T C jump seen in the C-T data of the Si substituted compounds decrease with <lb/>increasing Si concentration. This observation indicates the change in the order of <lb/></body>

			<body>transition from first order towards second order and corroborates with the magnetization <lb/>studies [35]. Similar observations have been reported by many other authors on other <lb/>RCo 2 -based systems. The inset of Fig. 11 shows the C-T plots of DyCo 2 obtained under <lb/>zero field and in a field of 50 kOe. The variation of MCE under various substitutions is <lb/>shown in Table 1. As is evident, substitutions, in general, tend to increase the T C and <lb/>decrease the MCE values in Er, Ho and Dy compounds. Fig. 12 shows the effect of <lb/>substitutions on the magnetic entropy change of several RCo 2 compounds. <lb/>Fig. 12 <lb/>max <lb/>M <lb/>S <lb/>∆ <lb/>vs. T C of RCo 2 -based compounds. The filled circles correspond to the <lb/>materials which show FOT whereas the open circles correspond to the materials with <lb/>SOT. [Fig taken from Ref. 25] <lb/>Its has been argued by several authors that in RCo 2 compounds the substitution of Co by <lb/>small amounts of magnetic or nonmagnetic elements does not alter the crystalline electric <lb/>field and therefore the R-moments remain unaltered [28]. Now, since the magnetization <lb/>tends to saturate around the T C , the resulting variations in the MCE are assumed to be <lb/>natural consequence of the T C variation. However, a careful examination of the <lb/>magnetization and MCE data clearly reveals that apart from the T C variations, the nature <lb/>of the transition does play a decisive role in determining the MCE, at least whenever <lb/>there is an increase in T C . At this juncture it is worth mentioning the report on <lb/>Dy(Co 0.925 Si 0.075 ) 2 and Dy(Co 0.85 Si 0.15 ) 2 compounds, which have the T C values of 164 K <lb/>and 154 K, respectively, with maximum ∆S M values of 6.5 and 5.3 Jkg -1 K -1 [27]. Based <lb/>on the data on Er(Co,Si) 2 compounds, a similar observation has been reported by Duc et <lb/>al. as well [25]. Therefore, the reduction in MCE due to substitutions at the Co site could <lb/>be explained as follows. The local magnetic moments arising from the positive <lb/>magnetovolume effect are not fully exchange coupled and therefore enhances the spin <lb/>fluctuations. The presence of spin fluctuations decreases the strength of IEM and <lb/>consequently weakens the first order nature of the transition at T C . Wang et al. have <lb/>studied the effect of nonmagnetic substitutions such as Al, Si, Ga and Ge for Co in <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>DyCo 2 and found that the substitutions cause an increase in T C , but the transition changes <lb/>from FOT to SOT [29]. Depending on the stability of the Co magnetic state, the <lb/>concentration (of the substituent) at which the FOT changes to SOT differs from one <lb/>compound to another. The detrimental role of the spin fluctuations on the strength of IEM <lb/>and MCE has been reported by Han et al. as well [30]. The presence of increased spin <lb/>fluctuations for small concentrations of nonmagnetic substituents on the properties such <lb/>as electrical resistivity of RCo 2 compounds has also been investigated in the past [53]. It <lb/>is of interest to note that there exists a correlation between the variations of T C and the <lb/>changes in the properties such as MCE and resistivity, in the substituted compounds. <lb/>Several studies have also revealed that the variation of adiabatic temperature change is <lb/>identical to that of the entropy change. The maximum values of ∆T ad obtained in some of <lb/>the compounds are also listed in Table 1. <lb/>The effect of substitutions on the magnetic properties and MCE of these compounds <lb/>could be understood by calculating the temperature variation of the Landau coefficients. <lb/>It is well known that the magnetic free energy, F(M,T), in general can be expressed as <lb/>Landau expansion in the magnetization (see equation 12) and the temperature and <lb/>magnetic field dependence of F(M,T) determines the nature of magnetic transition. The <lb/>Landau coefficients can be calculated using the equation of state, given by: <lb/>5 <lb/>3 <lb/>CM <lb/>BM <lb/>AM <lb/>H <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>(15) <lb/>It may be noted from equation 15 that the magnetization isotherms obtained at various <lb/>temperatures may allow one to determine the temperature variation of the Landau <lb/>coefficients. It is well known that the temperature dependence of the Landau coefficients <lb/>may be utilized to distinguish between the first and second order transitions of magnetic <lb/>materials [23, 34, 54]. It may be noted from equation 15 that the coefficient A <lb/>corresponds to inverse of susceptibility and therefore a minimum in the temperature <lb/>dependence of A is expected at the ordering temperature. The materials with negative A <lb/>are known to exhibit a second order transition whereas those having positive A but <lb/>negative B exhibit first order transition. In the following, the Landau analysis of the <lb/>magnetization data is demonstrated by taking the example of Si substitution for Co in <lb/>ErCo 2 . <lb/>The temperature variation of Landau coefficient (B) obtained for Er(Co 1-x Si x ) 2 <lb/>compounds with x=0 and 0.5 is shown in Fig. 13. It may be noted from the figure that for <lb/>both the compounds the sign of B near T C is negative and that its magnitude decreases <lb/>with increase in temperature. Therefore the temperature variation of B in both the <lb/>compounds indicates the presence of FOT at T C . It may also be seen that the magnitude <lb/>of B in Er(Co 0.95 Si 0.05 ) 2 at temperatures well below T C is lower than that of ErCo 2 . This <lb/>could be ascribed to the increase in the spin fluctuation contribution on Si substitution. <lb/>The effect of substitutions, as mentioned earlier, is to suppress the IEM and hence the B <lb/>values. <lb/></body>

Effect of pressure on the magnetocaloric effect <lb/>As mentioned in the earlier sections, there are several MCE studies in literature regarding <lb/>the substituted RCo 2 compounds. However, the studies of MCE under applied pressure <lb/>are very rare in these compounds. The only work available to this effect is on ErCo 2 <lb/>systems. Fig. 14 shows the MCE variation in ErCo 2 and Er(Co 0.95 Si 0.05 ) 2 compounds <lb/>under various pressures. The pressure dependence of <lb/>max <lb/>M <lb/>S <lb/>∆ <lb/>of both these compounds is <lb/>given in Table 2. It can be seen from Fig. 14 (also from Table 2) that, with increase in <lb/>pressure, the peak in the ∆S M vs T plot moves towards low temperatures in both the <lb/>compounds. However, in the parent compound, the <lb/>max <lb/>M <lb/>S <lb/>∆ <lb/>value of <lb/>max <lb/>M <lb/>S <lb/>∆ <lb/>almost remains <lb/>insensitive to pressure while in the substituted compounds, <lb/>max <lb/>M <lb/>S <lb/>∆ <lb/>it is found to increase. The <lb/>insensitiveness of MCE on applied pressure in the case of ErCo 2 is due to the fact that the <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>strength of IEM has diminished only nominally even at a pressure of about 7.7 kbar. <lb/>Hauser et al. [55] have indeed reported that the discontinuity (at T C ) in the magnetic <lb/>contribution to the electrical resistivity in ErCo 2 decreases to about 60 % as the pressure <lb/>is increased from 1 bar to ~16 kbar, which is attributed to the reduction in the strength of <lb/>IEM. In view of this, it is reasonable to assume that for a pressure of 7.7 kbar, the <lb/>reduction in the IEM strength is not very much and therefore would contribute only to a <lb/>nominal reduction in <lb/>max <lb/>M <lb/>S <lb/>∆ <lb/>. However, the reduction in T C brought about by pressure <lb/>would try to enhance <lb/>max <lb/>M <lb/>S <lb/>∆ <lb/>due to the reduction in the thermal spin fluctuations. <lb/>Therefore, it is quite possible that the reduction in MCE caused by the weakening of IEM <lb/>is just compensated by the increase in MCE arising out of the reduction in T C . Therefore, <lb/>the insensitiveness of MCE on pressure seen in the case of ErCo 2 is consistent with the <lb/>observations made by Hauser et al. [55]. <lb/>Fig. 14 Temperature dependence of isothermal entropy change (∆S M ) in Er(Co 1-x Si x ) 2 <lb/>compounds obtained for ∆H= 50 kOe, under various applied pressures (P). [Figure taken <lb/>from Ref. 42] <lb/>On the other hand, the pressure dependence of <lb/>max <lb/>M <lb/>S <lb/>∆ <lb/>in the case of Si substituted <lb/>compounds is quite considerable. The increase seen in <lb/>max <lb/>M <lb/>S <lb/>∆ <lb/>may be attributed to the <lb/>increase in the strength of IEM, which results from the reduction of spin fluctuations <lb/>related to the negative magnetovolume effect. As in the case of substitutions, Landau <lb/>analysis can be used to study the changes in the nature of transitions and MCE, with <lb/>increase in pressure as well. The temperature variation of Landau coefficient (B) obtained <lb/>for Er(Co 1-x Si x ) 2 compounds with x=0 and 0.5 for different pressures is shown in Fig. 15. <lb/>There is no change in the low temperature value of B in the case of ErCo 2 , while there is <lb/>a considerable increase in Er(Co 0.95 Si 0.05 ) 2 , with increase of pressure. This implies that the <lb/>strength of IEM increases considerably with pressure in the Si substituted compounds <lb/>whereas there is no significant change in ErCo 2 . It may also be noticed from this figure <lb/>that the difference between the low temperature B values of ErCo 2 and the Si-substituted <lb/>compounds almost vanishes with increase in pressure. The effect of applied pressure (in <lb/>the substituted compounds) is to compete with the positive magnetovolume effect caused <lb/>by substitutions and to reduce it. Consequently, the magnetic nature of the Co sublattice <lb/>in the Si-substituted compounds is more or less restored to that of ErCo 2 , by the applied <lb/></body>

			<body>pressure. This is exactly seen in Fig.15 which shows that at high pressures, the low <lb/>temperature B value of Er(Co 0.95 Si 0.05 ) 2 is almost equal to that of ErCo 2 . <lb/>At this point, it is of importance to note that the variation of Landau coefficient (B) with <lb/>pressure in the case of parent compounds showed that it is insensitive to pressure whereas <lb/>in the case of Si substituted compounds, it showed an increase in the magnitude. <lb/>Therefore, the variations in the magnitude of B with pressure are consistent with the <lb/>MCE variation, which implies that there is a strong correlation between the B value and <lb/>the MCE in RCo 2 -based IEM systems. In this context, it is of relevance to mention that <lb/>Yamada et al. [56] have indeed shown that the MCE in IEM systems is primarily <lb/>governed by the magnitude of B. Fujita et al. have also reported a similar dependence of <lb/>MCE on B in La(Fe,Si) 13 compounds which also is a well known IEM system [57]. Based <lb/>on the magnetization behaviour, it is expected that other nonmagnetic substitutions in <lb/>RCo 2 [R=Er, Ho and Dy] compounds would also result in similar correlation between <lb/>MCE and the Landau coefficient, B. <lb/>Fig. 15 Temperature (T) dependence of the Landau coefficient B, obtained under various <lb/>external pressures (P), in Er(Co 1-x Si x ) 2 compounds with x=0, 0.05.

[Figure taken from Ref.42] <lb/>5. <lb/>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS <lb/>In conclusion, the magnetic and magnetocaloric studies on the RCo 2 -based compounds <lb/>show that ErCo 2 , HoCo 2 and DyCo 2 exhibit first order magnetic transition and large <lb/>MCE. The nonmagnetic nature of Co sublattice in these compounds causes IEM at <lb/>temperatures close to the ordering temperature, which leads to first order transition. <lb/>Positive magnetovolume effect resulting from the substitution of nonmagnetic elements <lb/>for Co is found to suppress IEM and FOT, due to the enhanced spin fluctuations. The <lb/>spin fluctuations arising from the local moment formation are found to be detrimental to <lb/>MCE in the substituted compounds. On the other hand, application of pressure <lb/>destabilizes the Co sublattice magnetization because of the negative magnetovolume <lb/></body>

			<body>effect and therefore, the ordering temperature decreases. The effect of pressure on the <lb/>MCE is clearly seen in the substituted compounds in which, the negative magnetovolume <lb/>effect competes with the positive magnetovolume effect resulting from the substitutions. <lb/>The thermodynamic analysis based on the Landau&apos;s theory reveals that the MCE <lb/>variations follow the variations seen in the magnitude of the coefficient B of the Landau <lb/>free energy expression. The variations seen in the order of magnetic transition and the <lb/>MCE values seem to support the recent model proposed by Khmelevskyi and Mohn for <lb/>the occurrence of IEM in RCo 2 compounds. <lb/></body>
