			<body>The presence of a pseudogap in the normal state of <lb/>underdoped high temperature superconductors is by now <lb/>widely accepted. [1] The strongest evidence for the pseu-<lb/>dogap state comes from recent measurements of an-<lb/>gle resolved photoemission spectra [2] as well as vac-<lb/>uum tunneling [3]. However, these techniques both de-<lb/>mand extremely high surface quality and have therefore <lb/>mainly been restricted to Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ (Bi221) and <lb/>YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (Y123) materials, both with two CuO 2 <lb/>layers per unit cell. Techniques that probe deeper into <lb/>the sample such as dc transport [4-6], optical conduc-<lb/>tivity [7-9] and NMR [10] were not only the earliest to <lb/>show evidence of the pseudogap but have been extended <lb/>to a much larger variety of materials, including several <lb/>materials with one CuO 2 . [6] In all cases evidence for a <lb/>pseudogap has been reported. <lb/>The pseudogap in LSCO as seen by NMR and neu-<lb/>tron scattering [11] is rather weak and has led to the <lb/>suggestion that the existence of the pseudogap in the <lb/>spin excitation spectrum is only possible in bilayer com-<lb/>pounds such as Y123 and YBa 2 Cu 4 O 4 (Y124). In par-<lb/>ticular, Millis and Monien attribute the pseudogap (or <lb/>the spin gap) to strong antiferromagnetic correlations be-<lb/>tween the planes in the bilayer, which are responsible for <lb/>a quantum order-disorder transition. [10] <lb/>Apart <lb/>from <lb/>having <lb/>only one CuO 2 layer La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) is also a <lb/>good model system for the study of doping dependences <lb/>since it can be doped by the addition of strontium over <lb/>a wide range: from the underdoped, where T c increases <lb/>with Sr content, to the optimally doped where T c reaches <lb/>its maximum value of ≈ 40 K at x = 0.17, and to the <lb/>overdoped region where T c → 0 at x = 0.34. [6] <lb/>The characteristic signatures of the pseudogap state <lb/>in the dc resistivity [4] are seen clearly in LSCO [6,12]. <lb/>These are the striking deviations below a temperature T * <lb/>from the high temperature linear resistivity, resulting in <lb/>a clear break in slope at T * . It was found by B. Batlogg <lb/>et al. [6] that in LSCO T * decreases from 800 K to ap-<lb/>proximately 300 K as the doping level is increased from <lb/>the strongly underdoped to just over the optimal doping <lb/>level. Similar behavior at T = T * has been observed in <lb/>the Hall effect coefficient and the magnetic susceptibility. <lb/>[13,14] <lb/>The pseudogap can also be observed if the conductiv-<lb/>ity is measured in the frequency domain, σ(ω), where it <lb/>shows up as a striking depression of the frequency depen-<lb/>dent scattering rate at low frequency. It is found that <lb/>below a frequency Ω p ≈ 600 cm −1 , the scattering rate <lb/>drops below its high temperature, high frequency, linear <lb/>behavior. This effect has been clearly identified in the <lb/>bilayer materials. [7-9] One of the aims of this paper is <lb/>to see if this behavior can also be observed in LSCO. A <lb/>pseudogap state can be defined in terms of this suppres-<lb/>sion of scattering: the material is in the pseudogap state <lb/>when the scattering rate falls below the high frequency <lb/>straight-line extrapolation. In the low frequency limit <lb/>the scattering rate is proportional to the dc resistivity. <lb/>Due to this, the 1/τ (ω,T) suppression should be com-<lb/>pared to the suppression of ρ DC (T) [6] at temperatures <lb/>below the linear T dependence region. The IR measure-<lb/>ment gives us the possibility to see both the frequency <lb/>and the temperature dependence of this feature. <lb/>A pseudogap feature can also be observed in the c-<lb/></body>

In slightly <lb/>underdoped LSCO the pseudogap state in the c-axis di-<lb/>rection is not as well defined as it is in the two plane <lb/>materials. [7] However, as the doping is reduced further, <lb/>the c-axis pseudogap state features below 0.1 eV become <lb/>clearer. [17] <lb/>Previous work on the in-plane σ(ω) of the single layer <lb/>lanthanum strontium cuprate includes work on the oxy-<lb/>gen doped La 2 CuO 4−δ [18], thin films of LSCO [19] as <lb/>well as work done on LSCO single crystal at room tem-<lb/>perature [12]. To our knowledge, a study of the tem-<lb/>perature and doping dependence has not been done. We <lb/>fill this gap here by performing optical measurements on <lb/>high-quality LSCO single crystals at temperatures rang-<lb/>ing from 10 K to 300 K at two different doping levels, <lb/>both slightly underdoped. Also the optical properties of <lb/>both the ab-plane and c-axis of La 1.87 Sr 0.13 CuO 4 were <lb/>measured on the same crystal. <lb/>To better display the effect of increased coherence on <lb/>σ(ω) ab resulting from the formation of the pseudogap <lb/>state we use the memory function, or extended Drude <lb/>analysis.

The temperature sequences are 10 K, 40 K, <lb/>150 K, 200 K, 300 K and 400 K <lb/>dependent scattering rate and an effective electron mass. <lb/>[20,21] While the optical conductivity tends to emphasize <lb/>free particle behavior, a study of the frequency depen-<lb/>dence of the effective scattering rate puts more weight <lb/>on displaying the interactions of the free particles with <lb/>the elementary excitations of the system. [22] The tem-<lb/>perature evolution of the frequency dependent scattering <lb/>rate and effective mass spectra are of particular interest <lb/>and are defined as follows: <lb/>1/τ (ω, T ) = <lb/>ω 2 <lb/>p <lb/>4π <lb/>Re( <lb/>1 <lb/>σ(ω, T ) <lb/>) <lb/>(1) <lb/>m * (ω, T ) <lb/>m e <lb/>= <lb/>1 <lb/>ω <lb/>ω 2 <lb/>p <lb/>4π <lb/>Im( <lb/>1 <lb/>σ(ω, T ) <lb/>) <lb/>(2) <lb/>Here, σ(ω, T ) = σ 1 (ω, T ) + iσ 2 (ω, T ) is the complex <lb/>optical conductivity and ω p is the plasma frequency of <lb/>the charge carriers. <lb/>The single crystals of La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 with approx-<lb/>imate dimensions 5x3x3 mm 3 were grown by the <lb/>traveling-solvent floating zone technique at Oak Ridge <lb/>[23] in the case of x = 0.14 and in Tokyo [24] in the case <lb/>of x = 0.13. The critical temperature was determined by <lb/>both SQUID magnetization and resistivity measurements <lb/>and was found to be 36 K for the nominal concentration <lb/>of Sr x = 0.14 and 32 K for x = 0.13. Since the highest <lb/>T c in the LSCO system has been found to be 40 K for <lb/>x = 0.17, we conclude that both crystals are underdoped. <lb/>The crystal with x = 0.14 was aligned using Laue <lb/>diffraction and polished parallel to the CuO 2 planes. The <lb/>crystal with x = 0.13 was polished in Tokyo to yield <lb/>both ab-plane and ac-plane faces. Both surfaces were <lb/>measured.

[25] The miscut angle between the <lb/>polished surface normal and the c-axis was checked by <lb/>a high precision triple axis x-ray diffractometer and was <lb/>determined to be less than 0.8%. <lb/>All reflectivity measurements were performed with a <lb/>Michelson interferometer using three different detectors <lb/>which cover frequencies ranging from 10 to 10000 cm −1 <lb/>(1.25 meV -1.25 eV). The experimental uncertainty in <lb/>the reflectance data does not exceed 1%. The dc resis-<lb/>tivity measurements were carried out using a standard <lb/>4-probe technique. <lb/>The result of the resistivity measurement on the same <lb/>La 1.86 Sr 0.14 CuO 4 single crystal used in the optical mea-<lb/>surements is shown in Fig. 1. It is commonly accepted <lb/>that the DC-resistivity is linear at high temperatures for <lb/>LSCO and that the pseudogap begins to form near the <lb/>temperature where the resistivity drops below this lin-<lb/>ear trend. [6] At lower temperatures there is a region of <lb/>superlinear temperature dependent resistivity. The T * <lb/>value for our samples with x = 0.13 and x = 0.14 ex-<lb/>tracted from the phase diagram of Batlogg et al., [6] are <lb/>650 K and 450 K, respectively. In agreement with this, <lb/>the resistivity shows a superlinear temperature depen-<lb/>dence below room temperature as expected in the pseu-<lb/>dogap region. <lb/>In Fig. 2 we present the reflectivity data at temper-<lb/>atures above and below T c for the two samples. For <lb/>clarity, only three temperatures are shown: T = 300 K, <lb/>an intermediate temperature above the superconducting <lb/>transition and a low temperature ≈ 10 K in the super-<lb/>conducting state. In the frequency region shown the re-<lb/>flectance is strongly temperature dependent for both ma-<lb/>terials, dropping by approximately 10% as temperature <lb/>is increased from the lowest temperature to T = 300 K. <lb/>The plasma edge is observed at 7800 cm −1 (see insert <lb/>of Fig. 2). The distinct peaks at approximately 135 and <lb/>365 cm −1 in the LSCO reflectivity spectra correspond <lb/>to the excitation of ab-plane T O phonons and the peak <lb/>at 500 cm −1 corresponds to a LO phonon.

			<body>Since, in principle, this analysis requires knowledge of <lb/>the reflectance at all frequencies, reflectivity extensions <lb/>must be used at high and low frequencies. The Hagen-<lb/>Rubens formula was used for the low frequency reflectiv-<lb/>ity extrapolation, with parameters taken from the dc re-<lb/>sistivity measurements on the same sample with x = 0.14 <lb/>shown in Fig. 1 and the results of H. Takagi et al. [27] for <lb/>the sample with x = 0.13. For the high-frequency exten-<lb/>sion for ω &gt; 8000 cm −1 we used the reflectivity results of <lb/>Uchida et al. [12] At frequencies higher than 40 eV the <lb/>reflectivity was assumed to fall as 1/ω 4 . <lb/>We calculate the plasma frequency of the supercon-<lb/>ducting charge carriers and the London penetration <lb/>depth using the following formula: [28] <lb/>ǫ 1 = 1 − <lb/>ω 2 <lb/>ps <lb/>ω 2 . <lb/>(3) <lb/>The slope of the low-frequency dielectric function, <lb/>ǫ 1 (ω), plotted as a function of w −2 in Fig. 3a,b gives <lb/>plasma frequencies of 6100 cm −1 and 5700 cm −1 in the <lb/>superconducting state. The corresponding London pen-<lb/>etration depths are λ L = 1/2πω ps = 250 nm and 280 nm <lb/>for La 1.86 Sr 0.14 CuO 4 and La 1.87 Sr 0.13 CuO 4 , respectively. <lb/>These values are in good agreement with those obtained <lb/>previously by Gao et al. in films [19] (λ L = 275 ± 5 nm) <lb/>and by muon-spin-relaxation [29] (λ L = 250 nm). <lb/>The c-axis reflectance of the x = 0.13 sample is shown <lb/>in Fig. 4. The corresponding conductivity is low and is <lb/>dominated by optical phonons (Fig. 5). <lb/>In YBCO 123 and 124 the pseudogap in c-axis conduc-<lb/>tivity manifests itself as a depression in conductivity at <lb/>low frequency. [15,7,30] There is no coherent Drude peak <lb/>and the conductivity is flat and frequency independent. <lb/>In the temperature and doping range where a pseudogap <lb/>is expected a low frequency depression of conductivity is <lb/>seen with an edge in the 300-400 cm −1 region where the <lb/>conductivity rises to the high frequency plateau. <lb/>In order to isolate the electronic features of our LSCO <lb/>c-axis spectrum we magnify the low value region of σ 1c <lb/>(Fig. 5). There is no sharp pseudogap edge in the low-<lb/>frequency infrared data for underdoped LSCO as there <lb/>is in the case of Y123. It is possible that such a fea-<lb/>ture could be hidden under the large phonon structure. <lb/>Efforts to subtract the phonons in order to extract the <lb/>background conductivity were found to be extremely sen-<lb/>sitive to the choice of their shape in fitting procedures. <lb/>Nonetheless, the raw data clearly show that there is low <lb/>frequency depression of the c-axis conductivity. Conduc-<lb/>tivity at 450 cm −1 is uniformly suppressed below T=300 <lb/>K (Fig. 5insert), whereas the conductivity at 600 cm −1 is <lb/>nearly constant at all temperatures. Based on this anal-<lb/>ysis one can conclude that the pseudogap state in the c-<lb/>axis opens up below 300 K and its size is approximately <lb/>equal to 500 cm −1 . <lb/>Manifestations of the pseudogap in the ab-plane con-<lb/>ductivity exist as a loss of spectral weight between 700 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>m * <lb/>(ω)/m <lb/>e <lb/>0.00 <lb/>0.10 <lb/>0.20 <lb/>0.30 <lb/>Frequency (eV) <lb/>1000 <lb/>2000 <lb/>Frequency (cm -1 ) <lb/>0 <lb/>500 <lb/>1000 <lb/>1500 <lb/>2000 <lb/>2500 <lb/>3000 <lb/>3500 <lb/>4000 <lb/>1/τ (cm -1 <lb/>) <lb/>a) <lb/>c) <lb/>0.10 <lb/>0.20 <lb/>0.30 <lb/>0 <lb/>1000 <lb/>2000 <lb/>3000 <lb/>b) <lb/>d) <lb/>400 K <lb/>350 K <lb/>300 K <lb/>x = 0.14 ab plane <lb/>150 K <lb/>36 K <lb/>10 K <lb/>10 K <lb/>36 K <lb/>150 K <lb/>300 K <lb/>350 K <lb/>400 K <lb/>FIG. 9.

In both Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 one can <lb/>see the temperature evolution of the sharp depression in <lb/>ab-conductivity below 700 cm −1 at temperatures above <lb/>T c . A much clearer picture of the pseudogap state can <lb/>be seen from the effective scattering rate, 1/τ (ω,T), cal-<lb/>culated from the conductivity using equation (1) which is <lb/>shown along with the effective mass in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. <lb/>The 1/τ (ω,T) spectra can conveniently be divided into <lb/>two regions. In the high frequency region, starting at <lb/>about 700 cm −1 , the scattering rate varies linearly with <lb/>frequency while in the low frequency region there is a <lb/>clear suppression of 1/τ (ω,T) below this linear trend. <lb/>[31] The temperature where this suppression first appears <lb/>serves as a definition of T * , the onset temperature of the <lb/>pseudogap state. As the temperature is lowered below T * <lb/>this suppression becomes deeper. We find that for under-<lb/>doped La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 T * ≥ 400 K, an order of magnitude <lb/>higher than the superconducting transition temperature <lb/>T c (32 K). This is significantly different from previous <lb/>results on cuprates where T * more or less coincides with <lb/>T c near optimal doping. <lb/>The temperature dependence above 700 cm −1 is <lb/>strongly influenced by the level of Sr doping. In the <lb/>underdoped sample the high frequency scattering rate <lb/>is nearly temperature independent up to a certain tem-<lb/>perature (Fig. 8a and Fig. 9a), which we will call T * * <lb/>above which a pronounced temperature dependence of <lb/>1/τ (ω,T) is seen (Fig. 8b and Fig. 9b). In the x = 0.13 <lb/>sample T * * ≈ 200 K while in the x = 0.14 sample <lb/>T * * ≈ 150 K. In the overdoped samples the scattering <lb/>rate above 700 cm −1 increases uniformly with temper-<lb/>ature [32] at all temperatures suggesting T * * → 0 in <lb/>that limit. This behavior is also seen in other overdoped <lb/>HTSC. [31] <lb/>If one extrapolates the 300 K scattering rates to zero <lb/>frequency one finds that for the x = 0.13 sample the <lb/>scattering rate 1/τ 0 ≈ 2500 cm −1 and for the x = 0.13 <lb/>sample this rate is ≈ 1500 cm −1 . These scattering rates <lb/>are much higher than what is seen for the higher T c ma-<lb/>terials reviewed by Puchkov et al. [31] where at 300 K <lb/>1/τ 0 ≈ 1000 ± 200 cm −1 for several families and many <lb/>doping levels. This high residual scattering differentiates <lb/>the LSCO material from the other cuprates. <lb/>If we call the frequency below which the scattering rate <lb/>is suppressed the ab-plane pseudogap ω ab ≈ 700 cm −1 <lb/>we find it is clearly bigger than the c-axis pseudogap <lb/>frequency ω c ≈ 500 cm −1 <lb/>In addition to the pseudogap depth and temperature <lb/>dependence, several other features of Figures 8 and 9 <lb/>should be mentioned. The position of the pseudogap re-<lb/>mains at 700 cm −1 for all temperatures. There are also <lb/>several peaks positioned at 500 cm −1 in the scattering <lb/>rate which complicate the analysis, particularly in the <lb/>case of the sample with x = 0.14. These peaks have been <lb/>observed by other groups and have been attributed to po-<lb/>laronic effects. [33,34] Another possible explanation is the <lb/>correlation of the ab-plane conductivity with c-axis LO <lb/>phonons. We did observe the difference in contribution <lb/>of LO phonons to the ab plane reflectance with different <lb/>propagation directions, an effect first observed by Reedyk <lb/>et al., [35] and also seen in the k c vs. k ⊥ c spectra ob-<lb/>tained by Tanner&apos;s group. [18] In Fig. 10 the reflectance <lb/>with E a and k c, is compared with the reflectance <lb/>with E ab and k a, with the La 1.87 Sr 0.13 CuO 4 sample <lb/>at room temperature. There is an extra feature observed <lb/>at 500 cm −1 in the spectra with k c. Further evidence <lb/>that the c-axis LO phonons couples to ab plane features <lb/>can be seen in Fig. 11. The comparison between peaks in <lb/>the effective scattering rate at 450 cm −1 and 580 cm −1 to <lb/>the peaks in Im(-1/ǫ c ) shows the same strong correlation <lb/>seen in many other cuprates. [35] <lb/>For completeness we also plot the effective mass of un-<lb/>derdoped samples at low temperatures(Fig. 8c) and high <lb/>temperatures(Fig. 9c,d). As expected, m * (ω) <lb/>me <lb/>rises to a <lb/>maximum ≈ 3 forming a peak at ≈ 400 cm −1 . The en-<lb/>hancement of the effective mass in the pseudogap state <lb/>as well as the upper limit of m * (ω) <lb/>me <lb/>are similar to what <lb/>has been previously reported for Y123, Y124 and Bi2212. <lb/>[31] <lb/>Before closing we compare our results with data of Gao <lb/>et al. [19] on La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ films and Quijada et al. <lb/>[18] on oxygen doped La 2 CuO 4+δ . Our results in the un-<lb/>derdoped case are comparable with those of the oxygen <lb/>doped material, although Quijada et al. did not carry out <lb/>a frequency dependent scattering rate analysis for their <lb/>underdoped sample. The film results of Gao et al. are <lb/>quite different from our findings. The films used in that <lb/>study had a strontium level that would correspond to <lb/>optimal doping in crystals. However, the 1/τ (ω) curves <lb/>deviate markedly from what we observe for slightly under <lb/>and overdoped samples. The authors performed an ex-<lb/>tended Drude analysis and found a strongly temperature <lb/>dependent scattering rate even at low temperatures. This <lb/>is in sharp contrast to our results which would suggest <lb/>a very weak temperature dependence in this tempera-<lb/>ture region. Based on our work, their samples should be <lb/>in the pseudogap state since they have an x value near <lb/>optimal doping. Comparing these results with other sys-<lb/>tems, in particular with Tl2202, two factors suggest the <lb/>possibility that the films may be overdoped. First, their <lb/>T c was near 30 K, lower than that expected for optimal <lb/>doping. Secondly, it is known that the oxygen level in <lb/>films can vary substantially and in LSCO oxygen can <lb/>have a major influence on the doping level [36]. On the <lb/>other hand, we cannot completely rule out the possibility <lb/>that all the crystal results are affected by the polishing <lb/>process, and that the films better represent the bulk ma-<lb/>terial. It is clearly important to measure films where the <lb/>oxygen content is controlled by selective annealing. <lb/>In conclusion, the optical data in the far-infrared re-<lb/></body>

This pseudogap state extends to higher tempera-<lb/>tures than that observed in the multi-layered underdoped <lb/>cuprates such as YBCO and BSCO. <lb/>The scattering rate is similar for both systems in the <lb/>pseudogap state. At low frequencies, ω ≤ 700 cm −1 , the <lb/>scattering rates are temperature dependent and change <lb/>with frequency in a non-linear fashion. Above 700 cm −1 <lb/>this behavior becomes linear. Within experimental un-<lb/>certainty the observed high frequency scattering rate of <lb/>the underdoped sample is not affected by temperature up <lb/>to certain temperature T * * . This temperature is equal to <lb/>200 K in case of La 1.87 Sr 0.13 CuO 4 and 150 K in case of <lb/>La 1.86 Sr 0.14 CuO 4 . Above T * * the high frequency scat-<lb/>tering rate is temperature dependent. This behavior is <lb/>identical to the high-frequency effective scattering rate of <lb/>an overdoped HTSC. [31] <lb/>Our findings in the direction perpendicular to the <lb/>CuO 2 planes showed that the depression of the c-axis <lb/>conductivity is not as prominent as the one found in the <lb/>two layer HTSC. Nevertheless, the signature of the pseu-<lb/>dogap can be seen at the frequencies below 500 cm −1 up <lb/>to room temperature. <lb/>We would like to thank J.D. Garrett for help in align-<lb/>ing the sample and also P.C. Mason, M. Lumsden and <lb/>B.D. Gaulin for determining the miscut angle of the un-<lb/>derdoped LSCO crystal.
