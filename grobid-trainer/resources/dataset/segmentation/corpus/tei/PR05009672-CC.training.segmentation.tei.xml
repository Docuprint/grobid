			<body>The large body of vital spectroscopic data on the high-T c superconducting compound <lb/>Y 1 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (YBCO) measured in the far infrared (FIR) as well as the GHz-region has revealed <lb/>many interesting features. Among them are: the presence of one [1] or more [2] energy gaps in <lb/>the superconducting state, a temperature dependent penetration depth that is indicative of d-wave <lb/>pairing [3], and a quasiparticle scattering rate which is proportional to frequency in the normal state <lb/>[1] and which drops by four orders of magnitude at T c [4]. <lb/>The new technique of THz-time-domain spectroscopy bridges the gap between the FIR and the <lb/>GHz regime. THz measurements of YBCO display a peak in the temperature dependence of σ 1 below <lb/>T c , which appears to be related to a temperature-dependent scattering rate 1/τ rather than to BCS <lb/>coherence effects [5]. Other experiments using the same technique have revealed that the penetration <lb/>depth λ L , has a temperature-dependence inconsistent with BCS theory [6]. <lb/>Here we report results of a THz investigation into the Y 1−x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YPrBCO) system. <lb/>These measurements are of great interest because samples covering a wide range of critical tem-<lb/>peratures can be obtained simply by varying the Y/Pr ratio [7]. Also, because YPrBCO is fully <lb/>stoichiometric in the oxygen content, it is more homogeneous than oxygen-depleted YBCO and does <lb/>not change from an orthorhombic to a tetragonal lattice upon decreasing T c . Several mechanisms <lb/>have been proposed for the T c suppression, including a magnetic pair breaking effect [8] and depletion <lb/>of holes in the CuO 2 planes [9]. <lb/>Recently, the opening of a spin gap at temperatures above T c in oxygen-deficient YBCO has been <lb/>deduced from various experiments e.g. dc resistivity and Hall coefficient [10,11], neutron scattering <lb/>[12], and NMR measurements [13]. However, until now only one electro-magnetic measurement on <lb/>underdoped YBCO has been linked to the presence of a spin gap [1]. In this paper, we report evidence <lb/>for a spin gap obtained from measurements both at dc and at THz frequencies in YPrBCO, which is <lb/>consistent with Pr depleting holes from the CuO planes [9]. <lb/>Our spectroscopic technique involves a coherent time-domain measurement of a ps microwave <lb/>impulse E(t) transmitted through the sample [14]. A Fourier transform yields the complex transmis-<lb/>sion spectrum t(ω) and the complex conductivity σ(ω), without the use of Kramers-Kronig analysis. <lb/>The London penetration depth λ L (T ), the plasma frequency ω p in the clean limit, and the scattering <lb/>time τ (T ) are obtained with the aid of a two-fluid model. <lb/></body>

			<body>The microwave source is a biased 30 µm transmitting antenna fabricated on low temperature <lb/>grown GaAs, triggered with ∼100 fs optical pulses from a colliding-pulse modelocked dye laser. The <lb/>emitted microwave pulses have spectral components spanning the 0.1 -1.0 THz spectral region which <lb/>is difficult to access with conventional electronics [15]. The receiver is a 30 µm antenna, fabricated <lb/>on ion-implanted silicon-on-sapphire and gated with a second pulse from the laser. The receiver <lb/>photocurrent is proportional to the incident microwave field. <lb/>We investigated five YPrBCO samples having Pr composition x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 1.0. The <lb/>films are grown by pulsed laser deposition [16] onto NdGaO 3 substrates. The film thicknesses are <lb/>approximately 150 nm (Table I). NdGaO 3 is the ideal substrate because it remains transparent and <lb/>nondispersive over the entire spectral bandwidth of our pulses, as well as over the entire range of <lb/>temperatures investigated here. The excellent lattice match of NdGaO 3 to YPrBCO is a prerequisite <lb/>for a low density of misfit dislocations on the film-substrate interfaces. The substrates have a (001) <lb/>orientation, yieldingĉ oriented, twinned films. The critical temperatures T dc <lb/>c (Table I) are determined <lb/>from the temperature dependent resistivity, as measured with a four-point probe. <lb/>To calculate the conductivity, we make use of the multiple reflection formula for the field trans-<lb/>mitted through a layer of (complex) index n 2 , thickness d, bounded by media of index n 1 and n 3 : <lb/>t(ω) = <lb/>t 12 t 23 exp(in 2 (ω/c)d) <lb/>1 + r 12 r 23 exp(2in 2 (ω/c)d) <lb/>(1) <lb/>where t ij = 2n i /(n i + n j ) is the field transmission coefficient at the ijth interface, and r ij = <lb/>(n i − n j )/(n i + n j ) is the field reflection coefficient. In our geometry, n 1 represents vacuum, <lb/>n 2 = 1 + iσ(ω)/(ǫ 0 ω) is the index of the superconducting layer, and n 3 is the measured index <lb/>of the substrate. As n 2 (ω/c)d ≪ 1, and n 2 ≫ n 3 &gt; 1 in our samples, Eq. (1) reduces to <lb/>t(ω) = <lb/>1 + n 3 <lb/>1 + n 3 + Z o σ(ω)d <lb/>(2) <lb/>where Z 0 is the impedance of free space. <lb/>The effect of varying Pr content x (hereafter [Pr]) on the conductivity spectra σ(ω) at T = 50 K <lb/>is similar to the effect of varying the temperature for a given alloy (Fig. 1). The addition of Pr has <lb/>at least two interrelated effects: a) The suppression of T c changes the partitioning between normal <lb/>and superconducting carriers. b) The total number of carriers N (or their mobility) may be reduced. <lb/></body>

			<page>3 <lb/></page>

			<body>To the extent that the superconducting carriers make the largest contribution to σ 2 , both factors a) <lb/>and b) lead one to expect that at a given temperature, pure YBCO would have the largest σ 2 , and <lb/>it does. Samples with 20% and 30% Pr have smaller values of σ 2 , since they are only slightly below <lb/>their T c . The sample with 40% Pr has σ 2 ≈ 0 because it is above T c at 50 K. <lb/>Only normal carriers contribute to σ 1 for ω = 0, but now factors a) and b) compete. At 50 K, <lb/>σ 1 decreases with [Pr], therefore the effect of a reduction in N dominates the effect of the shift in T c <lb/>which increases the fraction of normal carriers. The data for pure YBCO and 20% Pr have been fit <lb/>to a frequency-dependent Drude form, and one can see that 1/τ lies in our spectral range. For 30% <lb/>and 40% Pr, we observe frequency independent σ 1 and can conclude that 1/τ is large compared to <lb/>1 THz. Pure PrBCO is a dielectric at 50 K, as seen by a conductivity proportional to frequency, i.e. <lb/>a dielectric constant independent of frequency. <lb/>Examining σ 2 at a fixed frequency, e.g. 480 GHz, we see that it is close to zero at high temperature, <lb/>but rises sharply at the onset of superconductivity, thus providing an independent ac measurement <lb/>of T c (Table I). <lb/>In all of the superconducting alloys, below T c , σ 1 displays a peak, which has been previously <lb/>observed only in fully oxygenated YBCO using microwave techniques [5,17] as well as measuring the <lb/>thermal conductivity [18]. It has been attributed to a sharp rise in the scattering time τ of normal <lb/>carriers below T c offsetting the decrease in the fraction of normal carriers, although coherence effects <lb/>remain a possibility. For pure YBCO, the peak value is about 20 times higher than σ 1 (100 K). <lb/>With increasing [Pr] the peak height in σ 1 decreases but the temperature corresponding to the peak <lb/>position does not shift significantly. <lb/>The normal state behavior of our samples is particularly interesting because underdoped materials <lb/>such as (124)YBCO and oxygen deprived (123)YBCO undergo a phase transition associated with <lb/>the opening of a spin gap at a temperature T D &gt; T c . Evidence for the presence of a spin gap has <lb/>been seen in neutron scattering [12,19], as well as in dc resistivity measurements [10,11]. Recent <lb/>experimental [20] and theoretical [9] work confirms that YPrBCO alloys are also underdoped, i.e. <lb/>superconductivity is suppressed, because holes are removed from the CuO 2 planes. <lb/>If the normal carriers couple strongly to spin fluctuations, the opening of a spin gap should be <lb/>accompanied by an increase in the scattering time τ , giving rise to an enhancement in σ 1 below T D <lb/></body>

			<body>for ω &lt; 1/τ . For pure (optimally doped) YBCO, at 480 GHz, σ 1 shows only a single transition at <lb/>T c (Fig. 2b). For the (underdoped) alloys, σ 1 has two transitions, one at T c , the other at a higher <lb/>temperature which increases with [Pr]. To accentuate the two transitions, Fig. 2b is shaded in the <lb/>region bounded by T c , the experimental curve, and a dashed line representing 1/(α + βT ) behavior. <lb/>The higher transition temperature seen at 480 GHz matches that of a transition also observed in <lb/>the dc resistivity (Fig. 3a). The transition is manifested as a deviation from a linear T dependence. <lb/>To show the deviation more clearly, the resistivity is first fit to a line ρ = α + βT between 250 <lb/>and 300 K, and then the experimental values are normalized to the value determined by the line as <lb/>follows: <lb/>ρ * = <lb/>ρ <lb/>α + βT <lb/>(3) <lb/>The normalized resistivity (Fig. 3b) of the YPrBCO alloys clearly shows a transition occurring at a <lb/>temperature above T c similar to that which has been observed in underdoped YBCO, and connected <lb/>to the opening of a spin gap [10,11]. <lb/>For the evaluation of λ L we are using a two fluid model of the form: <lb/>σ(ω) = <lb/>ǫ 0 ω 2 <lb/>p τ <lb/>1 − iωτ <lb/>x n + <lb/>1 <lb/>µ 0 λ 2 <lb/>L <lb/>−πδ(ω) + <lb/>i <lb/>ω <lb/>x s , <lb/>(4) <lb/>where ω p is the plasma frequency, and x n and x s are the fractions of normal and superconducting <lb/>carriers, given by x n +x s = 1. We derive the penetration depth from a fit to Eq. (4). In our frequency <lb/>range, we can ignore the Drude contribution to σ 2 for temperatures which are more than a degree <lb/>below T c . As x n = 0 at T = 0 in the two-fluid scenario, we have x s = (λ L (0)/λ L (T )) 2 . Shown in <lb/>Fig. 4 is the measured (λ L (0)/λ L (T )) 2 vs. T /T ac <lb/>c for all samples. Also plotted are theoretical curves <lb/>from weak-coupling BCS theory [21] and the functional form <lb/>(λ L (0)/λ L (T )) 2 = 1 − (T /T c ) α . <lb/>(5) <lb/>Power-law behavior in the dependence of λ L on T for T → 0 is one signature of &quot;unconventional <lb/>superconductivity&quot;, i.e. nodes in the energy gap in k-space [22]. Our data are intermediate between <lb/>BCS theory and α = 2, which is the exponent predicted for d-wave pairing with impurity scattering <lb/>[23]. Microwave measurements at lower frequencies have indicated both α = 1 (in the T → 0 limit) <lb/></body>

			<body>[3,24] and α = 2 [4]. The Gorter-Casimir two-fluid model (α = 4) [25], as well as d-wave pairing <lb/>(α = 1) are clearly inconsistent with our data. <lb/>λ L (0) is obtained by extrapolating λ L (T ) to T = 0 using a quadratic regression (Table I). Our <lb/>value for pure YBCO, 168 ± 2 nm, is close to the 145 nm value typical for good samples [4]. λ L (0) <lb/>increases with increasing [Pr] as the samples become less superconducting. <lb/>The plasma frequency ω p (Table 1) is determined with the relation ω p = c/λ L (0), which is valid <lb/>in the clean limit, provided all carriers are superconducting at T = 0. The clean limit assumption <lb/>becomes less valid upon substitution of Pr, therefore the values for the alloys are only estimates. <lb/>Our value of 9500 cm −1 in pure YBCO is close to the 12000 cm −1 value indicative of good sample <lb/>quality [2]. <lb/>The quasiparticle scattering rate is calculated by fitting Eq. (4) to the data for σ 1 and using, for <lb/>x n , the relation x n = 1 − x s = 1 − (λ L (0)/λ L (T )) 2 . We find that the scattering rate 1/τ decreases <lb/>slowly with decreasing temperature until T ≈ T c , after which it decreases exponentially rapidly <lb/>(Fig. 5), possibly reflecting the opening up of a gap in the fluctuation spectrum. Similar behavior <lb/>has been reported in YBCO samples [4]. The scattering rate 1/τ reveals an exponential decay below <lb/>T c by more than two orders of magnitude for all samples with different [Pr] [26]. Thus we are led to <lb/>conclude that this behavior is a universal feature of high-T c superconductivity. <lb/>For T &gt; T c , we find the surprising result that 1/τ decreases with [Pr] implying that alloy scattering <lb/>plays a negligible role, and that depletion of carriers in the CuO 2 planes dominates the scattering. It <lb/>should be noted, however, that the drop in 1/τ with [Pr] may be due to an underestimate of ω p , if the <lb/>clean limit assumption breaks down for the alloys. A more precise determination of the scattering <lb/>rate dependence on [Pr] above T c is beyond the scope of this letter. <lb/>In conclusion, we have presented complex conductivity experiments in the THz range on thin <lb/>films of Y 1−x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 . σ 1 (T ) reveals the anomalous coherence peak for all superconducting <lb/>alloys. Both the conductivity in the THz region and dc resistivity measurements provide evidence <lb/>for the opening of a spin gap in the excitation spectrum of the underdoped samples. σ 2 (ω, T ) yields <lb/>directly the penetration depth. For the superconducting YPrBCO alloys the plasma frequency ω p in <lb/>the clean limit decreases with [Pr] above T c due to a reduced number of carriers. The temperature <lb/>dependent quasiparticle scattering rate 1/τ (T ) shows an exponential drop below T c in all the alloys. <lb/></body>
