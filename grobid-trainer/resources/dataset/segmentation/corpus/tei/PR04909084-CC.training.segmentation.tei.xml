			<body>The superconductor-to-nonsuperconductor transitions in cuprates, as functions of carrier <lb/>concentration, give insights into quantum phase transitions (QPT&apos;s) in general [1] and into the <lb/>phenomenon of high temperature superconductivity in particular [2-4]. On the underdoped side, <lb/>the transition is from superconducting to an insulating state with a (pseudo)gap in the electronic <lb/>excitation spectrum that remains finite through the QPT. The fundamental physics on the <lb/>overdoped side of the phase diagram is profoundly different because there is no pseudogap, the <lb/>superconducting gap becomes progressively smaller [5] with doping, and the QPT is from <lb/>superconductor to a metal that looks like a conventional Fermi liquid in many respects. <lb/>Key issues are: (i) Are these transitions first-order or are they quantum critical points <lb/>(QCP) where quantum fluctuations of the order parameter are important? (ii) How does the <lb/>presence or absence of an energy gap impact the transitions? (iii) Are these transitions driven <lb/>by a collapse of the pairing amplitude or by fluctuations of the phase of the superconducting <lb/>order parameter? (iv) Does anisotropy (c-axis vs. ab-plane) affect the dimensionality of the <lb/>QCP&apos;s? <lb/>T c as a function of hole doping p takes a quasi-universal form [6], with <lb/>superconductivity existing for 0.3 ≲ p ≲ 0.30, with a maximum at p  0.15, independent of the <lb/>maximum value of T c or of c vs. ab-plane anisotropy. Thus, one might expect a common <lb/>explanation for the over-and underdoped quantum phase transitions in different compounds. <lb/>An early study of several underdoped cuprate compounds suggested that T c and <lb/>superfluid density [n s  λ -2 , λ = magnetic penetration depth] might be linearly proportional: T c <lb/> λ -2 (0), with a universal slope as critical underdoping is approached [7]. This linear scaling led <lb/>to the widely accepted view that classical thermal phase fluctuations destroy superconductivity <lb/>[4] in underdoped cuprates when the superfluid density becomes small, even as the energy gap <lb/></body>

			<body>remains intact. This long-standing view was overturned recently by measurements on severely <lb/>underdoped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7-δ (YBCO) films [8] and crystals [9] showing that scaling is actually <lb/>sublinear: T c  [λ -2 (0)] α with α  0.5. Sublinear scaling, together with the absence of critical <lb/>thermal fluctuations near T c , pointed to a 3D QCP [2,3]. The QCP hypothesis was put to a <lb/>stringent test in a study of two-unit-cell-thick underdoped YBCO films that were 2D by <lb/>construction. Indeed, linear scaling expected near a 2D QCP was observed for these ultrathin <lb/>films [10]. <lb/>The present work focuses on the overdoped QPT in La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO). While the <lb/>underdoped regime has been explored in several materials, studies in the overdoped regime <lb/>have focused largely on a single material: T 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+δ (T2201) [11,12]. We are motivated to <lb/>study LSCO because it can be doped through both over-and underdoped quantum phase <lb/>transitions, and it is much less anisotropic than T2201, thus allowing us to address the key <lb/>question of the effective dimensionality of fluctuations. Our main results are: <lb/>(1) All overdoped samples with high Sr concentrations, x &gt; 0.22, have sharp <lb/>superconducting-to-normal thermal phase transitions, as narrow as 200 mK near the <lb/>QPT. This suggests that the overdoped QPT is not dominated by inhomogeneity or <lb/>phase separation. <lb/>(2) Near the overdoped QPT, we find sublinear scaling T c  [λ -2 (0)] α with α  0.5 for <lb/>LSCO, in contrast to the linear scaling (α  1.0) seen in T2201 [11,12]. <lb/>(3) We argue that scaling with α  0.5 is consistent with either (a) a mean-field QPT driven <lb/>by gap collapse in a disordered d-wave superconductor, or (b) a 3D quantum critical <lb/>point (QCP). In case (a), asymptotically close to the QPT one must take into account <lb/></body>

			<body>critical fluctuations. Case (b) permits us to reconcile the square-root scaling in LSCO <lb/>with the linear scaling in T2201. <lb/>Our La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 films were grown by MBE on (001) LaSrAlO 4 (LSAO) substrates [13] <lb/>(see Table I). The films&apos; c-axes are perpendicular to the substrate. Compressive strain due to a <lb/>0.6% lattice mismatch (a = 3.754 Ǻ for LSAO and 3.777 Ǻ for LSCO) gives our films a <lb/>maximum T c ( 44 K) several K above the maximum T c of LSCO crystals. Sr doping values are <lb/>nominal. They are set by atomic beam fluxes during deposition. Well after the first series of <lb/>films (d = 45 nm) was grown, we decided to grow two additional films, at x = 0.27 and 0.30 (d <lb/>= 90 nm; last two rows of Table I). These films have somewhat higher resistivities, T c &apos;s and <lb/>superfluid densities than for the first series, possibly due to a different oxygen vacancy <lb/>concentration. <lb/>Two samples were grown simultaneously at each Sr concentration, one on a narrow <lb/>substrate for measuring resistivity and the other on a 10100.35 mm 3 substrate for measuring <lb/>λ -2 . Sheet conductivity, σd = σ 1 d -iσ 2 d, was measured with a low-frequency (/2π = 50 kHz) <lb/>two-coil mutual inductance technique, with drive and pickup coils on opposite sides of the film <lb/>[14]. Near T c , the real part of the conductivity σ 1 (T) has a peak that probes the spatial <lb/>homogeneity of T c . The imaginary part, σ 2 (T), yields the magnetic penetration depth λ via: λ -<lb/>2 (T) ≡ μ 0 σ 2 (T). λ -2 (T) is often loosely referred to as &quot;superfluid density&quot;, n s , since the two are <lb/>proportional. <lb/>The ab-plane resistivities of our films decrease smoothly with doping, Fig. 1, achieving a <lb/>low residual resistivity of about 40 μ cm at the highest doping, comparable to that of a <lb/>similarly overdoped LSCO crystal [15]. &quot;T c &quot; defined from where ρ ab vanishes, agrees within a <lb/>degree or so with &quot;T c &quot; defined from where superfluid appears. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figures 2 and 3 show λ -2 (T) for representative LSCO films, illustrating the qualitative <lb/>feature that λ -2 (T) for overdoped films has less downward curvature than for under-and <lb/>optimally-doped films. The same qualitative effect is seen in LSCO powders [16] and in <lb/>T2201 powders [11,12,17]. σ 1 is plotted as μ 0 σ 1 , (μ 0 = permeability of vacuum = 410 -7 <lb/>H/m), to facilitate quantitative comparison with λ -2 ≡ μ 0 σ 2 . Peaks in σ 1 (T) (Figs. 2 and 3) <lb/>probe film homogeneity. Films with x ≤ 0.21 have peaks with structure indicating the presence <lb/>of several closely-spaced T c &apos;s over the mm-scale area probed. On the other hand, films with x  <lb/>0.24 have single peaks about 1 K wide, e.g., the x = 0.30 film in Fig. 2. The peak is only 0.2 K <lb/>wide for the film closest to the QPT (Fig. 3), consistent with good film homogeneity, although <lb/>there are other experiments [17] suggesting a phase-separated overdoped superconducting state. <lb/>It is important to establish the quality of our films by comparison with the literature. T c vs. x <lb/>for films (black squares in Fig. 4) follows the usual path, peaking at x  0.15 and heading <lb/>toward zero at x  0.03 and 0.30. λ -2 (0) vs. x for films (red squares in Fig. 4) tracks that of <lb/>LSCO powders (green circles) [18] up to x  0.18. λ -2 (0) of our films decreases with strong <lb/>overdoping, with a peak near x  0.19, consistent with overdoped T2201[11,12] and other <lb/>LSCO films [19]. Resistivity and superfluid density measurements show that our films are <lb/>essentially of the same quality as bulk samples. <lb/>A detailed examination of how the magnitude and T-dependence of superfluid density <lb/>change across the phase diagram is presented elsewhere [20]. Here we focus on scaling between <lb/>T c vs. λ -2 (0), Fig. 5. Data from our under-and overdoped LSCO films are shown as open and <lb/>filled red squares, respectively. Data on other cuprates [8,10] are shown for comparison (see <lb/>caption). The solid gray line representing square-root scaling is drawn through the underdoped <lb/>Ca-YBCO thick film data, but it is close to the underdoped LSCO data, too. The solid red line <lb/></body>

			<body>representing square root scaling is drawn through the data for strongly overdoped LSCO films. <lb/>The light blue line representing linear scaling is drawn through the data for two-unit-cell thick <lb/>Ca-doped YBCO. <lb/>Let us ask why n s decreases with overdoping, even though the carrier density increases. <lb/>The most natural explanation is the interplay between disorder (scattering rate 1/) and a d-<lb/>wave pairing interaction, and thus gap  0 , that weakens with overdoping. In a disordered d-<lb/>wave superconductor, a simple sum-rule argument suggests a linear suppression of n s (0) to zero <lb/>with increasing 1/ 0 borne out by detailed calculations [21]. In addition, the dirty d-wave T c <lb/>exhibits a square-root suppression to zero with 1/ 0 so that: T c ~ [λ -2 (0)] 1/2 . We note this <lb/>is a mean-field result, and for doping close enough to the QPT, the superfluid density <lb/>necessarily becomes so small that quantum phase fluctuations dominate the physics. It is not <lb/>known where the crossover to this asymptotic behavior occurs. <lb/>Well-known scaling arguments predict [1-3] that T c  [λ -2 (0)] α near a QCP, with <lb/>exponent α ≡ z Q /(z Q + D -2), where D = dimensionality and z Q = quantum dynamical exponent. <lb/>Since z Q should not be less than unity, in D = 3 the smallest reasonable exponent is α = ½, <lb/>which is coincidentally the same as the dirty-d-wave mean field result. This describes the <lb/>observed nonlinear scaling in overdoped LSCO reasonably well. <lb/>The QCP interpretation also permits us to understand the linear scaling in overdoped <lb/>T2201 [11,12]. It is reasonable to expect 2D fluctuations in T2201, which is much more <lb/>anisotropic than LSCO. For D = 2, the exponent α = 1, independent of z Q . Thus the different <lb/>scalings seen in LSCO and T2201 can be attributed to the different dimensionalities of the <lb/>fluctuations. <lb/></body>

		<body>It is worth noting that there is experimental evidence for significant interlayer coupling <lb/>in overdoped LSCO. Ironically, this evidence comes from a 2D, Kosterlitz-Thouless-<lb/>Berezinski-like transition seen in the most overdoped film, i.e., the abrupt downturn in λ -2 near <lb/>the intersection of the KTB line with λ -2 (T) (Fig. 3). The slope of the KTB line in Fig. 3 is <lb/>calculated assuming that the film fluctuates as a single 2D entity. For independently fluctuating <lb/>layers, the slope of the KTB line would be 70 times larger. Analogous features appear in <lb/>microwave measurements of σ in underdoped LSCO films [22], indicating significant interlayer <lb/>coupling across the LSCO phase diagram. Finally, similar evidence for interlayer coupling is <lb/>found in &quot;thick&quot; underdoped YBCO films, which also show 3D critical scaling [23]. <lb/>In summary, we observe in overdoped LSCO that superconductivity diminishes with T c <lb/>~ [λ -2 (0)] 1/2 . Taken by itself, this behavior may be viewed as a consequence of a mean-field gap <lb/>collapse in a disordered d-wave superconductor. On the other hand, if one seeks a common <lb/>explanation for the nonlinear scaling in LSCO and the linear scaling in T2201, then one is led <lb/>to the interpretation that the scaling observed for strongly overdoped samples is due to 3D and <lb/>2D quantum critical points, respectively. The difference in dimensionality would be due to the <lb/>much higher anisotropy of T2201. Finally, in moderately underdoped LSCO we observe <lb/>nonlinear T c vs. λ -2 (0) scaling that is quantitatively similar to that of underdoped YBCO. <lb/>However, data on severely underdoped LSCO samples are needed to establish a 3D QCP on the <lb/>underdoped side. <lb/></body>
