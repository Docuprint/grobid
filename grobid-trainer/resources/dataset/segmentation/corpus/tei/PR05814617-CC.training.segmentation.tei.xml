			<body>The in-plane thermal conductivity (κ ab ) of cuprate <lb/>superconductors has been studied extensively over the <lb/>past several years. 1 Unresolved issues remain concern-<lb/>ing the normal-state temperature dependence and the <lb/>superconducting-state enhancement. Because of the low <lb/>carrier density, heat conduction by the lattice accounts <lb/>for more than half of the measured normal-state κ ab in <lb/>these materials. One would expect κ ab (T ) in high-quality <lb/>crystals to reflect a dominant lattice contribution simi-<lb/>lar to that of crystalline insulators, i.e. κ ab ∼ 1/T at <lb/>high-T , rising sharply to a maximum at low T . This be-<lb/>havior is observed in Nd 2−x Ce x CuO 4 (Nd-214), 2 but for <lb/>all other cuprates investigated κ ab is very weakly T de-<lb/>pendent for T &gt; T c . Whereas for Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCuO 8 struc-<lb/>tural disorder (e.g., the Bi-O layer modulation 3 ) might <lb/>explain its nearly glass-like lattice contribution, 4 this <lb/>would not seem applicable to YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+x (Y-123) and <lb/>La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (La-214). Furthermore, κ ab (T ) for un-<lb/>doped, insulating Y-123 and La-214 is unconventional, 5 <lb/>suggesting that the weak T -dependence of κ ab is generic <lb/>to the latter materials and not directly related to <lb/>the presence of free charge. An unidentified phonon <lb/>damping mechanism appears to underlie this behavior, <lb/>possibly due to local lattice distortions 5 and/or mag-<lb/>netic excitations. 6 Regarding the enhancement, 4,7 ther-<lb/>mal Hall conductivity experiments 8 on optimally-doped <lb/>Y-123 imply that the phenomenon is largely electronic in <lb/>origin, but less is known about underdoped compounds. <lb/>The magnitude of the enhancement correlates with the <lb/>superconducting pair density 9,10 in Y-123 throughout <lb/>the underdoped regime, and it is of interest to explore <lb/>the generality of this behavior through studies of other <lb/>cuprates. <lb/>Here we report measurements of the in-plane thermal <lb/>conductivity of YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 (Y-124). This material is of <lb/>particular interest with regard to the issues mentioned <lb/>above because of its structural similarity to Y-123, ab-<lb/>sence of oxygen vacancies on the CuO chains, and the <lb/>naturally underdoped state of the CuO 2 planes. We find <lb/>that the magnitude of κ a (transverse to the chains) at <lb/>T =300K is comparable to that of Y-123, but κ b is 3-<lb/>4 times larger. A very large in-plane anisotropy in the <lb/>lattice conduction is implied. Both κ a (T ) and κ b (T ) be-<lb/>have as in conventional crystalline insulators (like Nd-<lb/>214); their maximum values (at T ≃ 20K) are the highest <lb/>reported for any cuprate and exceed those of Y-123 by an <lb/>order of magnitude. These results imply a strong damp-<lb/>ing of phonons by static or dynamic structural distortions <lb/>as the source for the much weaker T dependence of κ ab <lb/>in Y-123. The superconducting-state enhancement for <lb/>Y-124 is comparable in magnitude to that of T c =60K Y-<lb/>123, consistent with the underdoped state of the planes in <lb/>the double-chain compound. We discuss the anisotropy <lb/>of the enhancement and its implications for the Lorenz <lb/>number. <lb/>Thermal conductivity measurements were performed <lb/>on three single crystals grown by a high-pressure flux <lb/>method as described previously. 11 Two of these (189 and <lb/>259) were grown in Al 2 O 3 crucibles yielding a slight Al <lb/>contamination, and T c = 72K. Recent analyses indicate 12 <lb/>that Al substitutes for 1-2% of the Cu(2) atoms in the <lb/>CuO 2 planes. As we discuss below, this light doping has a <lb/>substantial effect on the thermal conductivity. The third <lb/>crystal (315), grown in Y 2 O 3 and without Al contami-<lb/>nation, had T c = 80K. Typical crystal dimensions were <lb/>0.8 × 0.5 × 0.05mm 3 , with the shortest dimension along <lb/>the crystalline c axis. The a-and b-axis electrical resis-<lb/>tivities of similarly-prepared crystals have been discussed <lb/>extensively elsewhere; 13 typical values at T =300K are <lb/>ρ a = 400µΩcm and ρ b = 130µΩcm. The steady-state <lb/>thermal conductivity measurements employed a fine-wire <lb/>differential chromel-constantan thermocouple and minia-<lb/>ture chip resistor as heater, both glued to the specimen <lb/>with varnish or epoxy. The absolute accuracy of the mea-<lb/>surements is ±20% due to uncertainty in the placement <lb/>of the thermocouple junctions. No corrections for heat <lb/></body>

			<body>losses (via radiation and conduction through the leads) <lb/>have been applied; these are estimated to be ∼ 10% <lb/>near room temperature and &lt; <lb/>∼ 2% at T &lt; <lb/>∼ 120K. For <lb/>specimens 259 and 315 gold contacts were vapor de-<lb/>posited and their a-axis thermoelectric powers measured, <lb/>yielding S(290K) = 36µV/K and 16µV/K, respectively. <lb/>These values provide estimates of the hole concentration <lb/>per planar Cu atom, 14 p ≃ 0.09 and 0.11 for the Al-doped <lb/>and undoped specimens, respectively. <lb/>The results for κ a and κ b are shown in Fig. 1. <lb/>The anisotropy in the normal state is substantial, with <lb/>κ b /κ a ∼ 3−4 (Fig. 2). The normal-state T dependence in <lb/>both crystallographic directions is close to 1/T for spec-<lb/>imen 315 and is significantly weaker (∼ 1/T 1/2 ) for the <lb/>crystals containing Al. In all cases the T -dependence is <lb/>substantially stronger than that of both T c = 92K and <lb/>60K Y-123 (solid lines, Fig. 1). At low T the character-<lb/>istic dielectric maxima are observed near 20K. A change <lb/>in slope is evident at T c [Fig. 3 (a)] for all specimens, <lb/>though not appearing as prominent as in Y-123 because <lb/>of the substantially stronger normal-state T dependence. <lb/>The low-T maximum values, κ b ≃ 140 and 245 W/mK <lb/>for samples 189 and 259, respectively (and 500W/mK for <lb/>crystal 315 by extrapolation), are the largest reported for <lb/>any cuprate, exceeding the 100W/mK of insulating Nd-<lb/>214, 2 and 25-40 W/mK observed in untwinned T c = 92K <lb/>Y-123. 15,16,17,18,19 These observations indicate substan-<lb/>tially superior and rather conventional lattice conduction <lb/>in Y-124, confirming a similar conclusion based on pre-<lb/>vious measurements of polycrystals. 20 <lb/>10 <lb/>100 <lb/>10 <lb/>100 <lb/>κ(W/mK) <lb/>T(K) <lb/>189 <lb/>259 <lb/>Y-124 <lb/>Y-123 <lb/>315 <lb/>1/T <lb/>92K <lb/>60K (×2) <lb/>∇T||b <lb/>∇T||a <lb/>FIG. 1. κa(T ) and κ b (T ) for three Y-124 crystals. Speci-<lb/>mens 189 and 259 are lightly Al-doped. Data for Y-123 crys-<lb/>tals (solids lines) are from Ref. 16 (Tc = 92K) and Ref. 6 <lb/>(Tc = 60K). <lb/>The total thermal conductivity is a sum of elec-<lb/>tronic and lattice components, κ = κ e + κ L . First <lb/>let us consider the electronic contributions, κ a,e and <lb/>κ b,e . The Wiedemann-Franz law, κ e (T ) = L 0 T /ρ (L 0 = <lb/>2.44 × 10 −8 WΩ/K 2 ), and electrical resistivities 13 pro-<lb/>vide upper-bound estimates: κ e,a (300K) ≈ 2W/mK and <lb/>κ e,b (300K) ≈ 6W/mK. These imply κ L,a ≈ 8W/mK and <lb/>κ L,b ≈ 25 − 39W/mK, and the very large in-plane lat-<lb/>tice anisotropy, κ L,b /κ L,a ∼ 3 − 4. This is to be con-<lb/>trasted with Y-123 where similar analyses suggest that <lb/>κ L is nearly isotropic in the planes. 16,17,18,19 Since Y-124 <lb/>and Y-123 differ only in their CuO-chain structures, we <lb/>must conclude that the strong lattice anisotropy in Y-124 <lb/>is directly connected with the chain-related vibrational <lb/>spectrum. <lb/>Anisotropy in κ L can arise from either anisotropy of <lb/>the phonon group velocities, their relaxation times, or <lb/>both. Though optic modes can contribute to heat trans-<lb/>port and the anisotropy, their contribution should dimin-<lb/>ish with decreasing temperature as should any associ-<lb/>ated anisotropy. 21 This is contrary to our observation <lb/>that κ b /κ a in the normal-state is nearly constant or in-<lb/>creases with decreasing T (Fig. 2) [the decrease in κ b /κ a <lb/>below T c is related to superconductivity, as discussed be-<lb/>low]. Experimental dispersion curves are not available for <lb/>Y-124, however the computed spectrum 22 is quite simi-<lb/>lar to that of Y-123, and does not imply a substantial <lb/>in-plane anisotropy in the acoustic-mode group veloci-<lb/>ties. These observations would suggest a large anisotropy <lb/>in the phonon relaxation rates in Y-124, but further in-<lb/>formation about the low-energy vibrational spectrum is <lb/>clearly needed to address this issue. <lb/>The rather strong influence of the light Al doping in <lb/>the planes on κ provides insight into the phonon scat-<lb/>tering in both Y-124 and Y-123.

			<body>resonance studies of similar Y-124 crystalsreveal substan-<lb/>tially larger 63 Cu linewidths in the Al-doped crystals, <lb/>attributed to static disorder in the Cu(2)-apical oxygen <lb/>bondlengths (a typical Al-O bondlength for octahedral <lb/>coordination is 1.94Å as compared with 2.28Å for Cu-<lb/>O). Such local structural distortions evidently represent <lb/>a much more effective phonon scattering mechanism than <lb/>does the mass defect 23,24 introduced by the substitution. <lb/>The local structural modifications may also explain why <lb/>the hole concentration and T c are so dramatically sup-<lb/>pressed -the 2% Al substitution for planar Cu reduces <lb/>the mobile planar hole concentration by about 20%, i.e. <lb/>a ten-fold larger reduction than would be expected if <lb/>each Al atom filled one hole. This observation suggests <lb/>that the suppression of mobile holes, by the combined <lb/>effects of charge compensation, disorder-induced local-<lb/>ization, and changes in the local electronic structure, ex-<lb/>tends to next nearest neighbors of each Al atom in the <lb/>planes. <lb/>In Y-123 a similar static disorder in the apical <lb/>bondlengths is induced by oxygen vacancies on the <lb/>chains 25 and there is evidence for static or dynamical <lb/>structural distortions of the CuO 2 planes in the normal <lb/>state, 26 possibly related to oxygen vacancies or diffusion <lb/>that are absent in Y-124. The implication is that these <lb/>features give rise to substantial damping of in-plane heat-<lb/>carrying phonons, and are the origin of the weaker T -<lb/>dependence and in-plane anisotropy observed for κ in the <lb/>single-chain compound. <lb/>It is of interest to compare the superconducting-state <lb/>enhancement of κ for Y-124 with that of Y-123. 9,10 We <lb/>define the enhancement as 10 Γ ≡ −d(κ s /κ n )/dt| t→1 , the <lb/>reduced temperature derivative of the superconducting <lb/>to normal-state thermal conductivity ratio near T c . κ n is <lb/>determined by a polynomial extrapolation of the normal-<lb/>state data just below T c as shown in Fig. 3 (a). Fig-<lb/>ure 3 (b) shows the normalized data and corresponding <lb/>slopes. <lb/>The Γ values agree with those found for twinned Y-<lb/>123 at similar p values, 10 indicating that for the regime <lb/>investigated here (p ≤ 0.11), Γ is largely determined by <lb/>the change in scattering that occurs in the CuO 2 planes. <lb/>That Γ a is larger for Al-free specimen 315 than for spec-<lb/>imen 259 is consistent with the higher mobile hole con-<lb/>centration in the planes of the former. Also of interest is <lb/>the anisotropy: Γ a /Γ b ≈ 1.5 for specimen 259. Evidently <lb/>this anisotropy is responsible for the decrease in κ b /κ a at <lb/>T ≤ T c (Fig. 2). A similar behavior was observed for un-<lb/>twinned Y-123 (x ∼ 0.9) [solid and dashed lines in Fig. 2], <lb/>where the enhancement is also anisotropic, 16,17,18,19 with <lb/>a slightly smaller Γ a /Γ b ≈ 1.2 − 1.5. <lb/>Consider Γ in more detail. We may write, <lb/>Γ i = (κ e,i /κ i )Γ e,i + (κ L,i /κ i )Γ L,i , <lb/>(1) <lb/>where i = a, b, and Γ e,i and Γ L,i are the i-axis electronic <lb/>and lattice slope changes, respectively. The thermal con-<lb/>ductivities are evaluated at T c .

The <lb/>data for specimen 315 (solid squares) are shifted vertically by <lb/>0.01 for clarity. <lb/>sum of two terms: one proportional to d∆ 2 /dt| t=1 and <lb/>the other proportional to −d(τ s <lb/>qp /τ n <lb/>qp )/dt| t=1 (∆ and τ qp <lb/>are the real part of the superconducting gap and quasi-<lb/>particle (qp) lifetime, respectively). In the cuprates, the <lb/>second term predominates due to the strong suppression <lb/>of qp scattering 28 at T &lt; T c , and Γ e is positive. Scat-<lb/>tering of phonons by charge carriers always produces a <lb/>positive lattice term (Γ L ), but the thermal Hall conduc-<lb/>tivity measurements of Krishana et al. 8 indicate that the <lb/>electronic contribution to the enhancement predominates <lb/>in optimally-doped Y-123. Their data for twinned Y-<lb/>123 (x ∼ 0.9) yields: Γ ab ≃ 1.4, Γ e,ab ≃ 12.5, and <lb/>κ e,ab /κ ab ≃ 9 × 10 −2 . Thus, Γ L,ab ≃ 0.3, and about <lb/>80% of the slope change for optimally-doped Y-123 is <lb/>electronic in origin. Recent measurements 29 suggest that <lb/></body>

		<body>the slope change in underdoped Y-123 is also largely elec-<lb/>tronic in origin, and thus it is likely that this conclusion <lb/>also applies to Y-124. <lb/>Given these observations, one might expect that the Γ <lb/>anisotropy simply follows that of the superfluid, with the <lb/>larger qp lifetime enhancement occurring for transport <lb/>along the crystallographic direction characterized by the <lb/>largest superfluid density. However, this is not the case; <lb/>for Y-123 and Y-124 the superfluid density is 2-3 times <lb/>larger along the chains, 30,31,32 whereas Γ is larger along <lb/>the planes. To get further insight into the origin of the <lb/>Γ anisotropy, we examine the limiting case, Γ L,i = 0, for <lb/>which Γ i is determined entirely by the electronic term. <lb/>The electronic superconducting-state slope change may <lb/>be related to the low-frequency electrical conductivity <lb/>via the Wiedemann-Franz law, 33 κ e,i = L i σ 1i T , where L i <lb/>and σ 1i are the Lorenz number and real part of the elec-<lb/>trical conductivity, respectively. Substituting into Eq. 1 <lb/>we have <lb/>Γ i = − <lb/>L i σ 1i T 2 <lb/>c <lb/>κ i <lb/>1 <lb/>L i <lb/>dL s <lb/>i <lb/>dT <lb/>− <lb/>dL n <lb/>i <lb/>dT <lb/>+ <lb/>1 <lb/>σ 1 i <lb/>dσ s <lb/>1i <lb/>dT <lb/>− <lb/>dσ n <lb/>1i <lb/>dT <lb/>T =Tc <lb/>(2) <lb/>Theoretically, the first term has magnitude and sign that <lb/>are highly model dependent. 34 We first examine the sec-<lb/>ond term. For untwinned, optimally-doped Y-123, the <lb/>microwave data of Zhang et al. 30 yield, (dσ s <lb/>1a /dT )| Tc ≃ <lb/>−0.8 × 10 5 (Ω m K) −1 and (dσ s <lb/>1b /dT )| Tc ≃ −1.8 × 10 5 (Ω <lb/>m K) −1 . For the normal-state data we employ dσ/dT = <lb/>−(1/ρ 2 )dρ/dT and an average of ρ(T ) measurements <lb/>on high-quality untwinned crystals 35 : ρ a (T c ) ≃ 75 ± <lb/>25µΩcm, dρ a /dT | Tc ≃ 0.85 ± 0.25µΩcm/K, ρ b (T c ) ≃ <lb/>38 ± 12µΩcm, dρ b /dT | Tc ≃ 0.35 ± 0.10µΩcm/K. For the <lb/>κ data we use, 17 κ a (T c ) = 11.5W/mK and κ b (T c ) = <lb/>16.0W/mK. With these values, the second terms in the <lb/>expressions for Γ a and Γ b are, (1.2 ± 0.2)L a /L 0 and <lb/>(2.0 ± 0.2)L b /L 0 , respectively. Experiments 16,17,18,19 in-<lb/>dicate Γ a = 1.5 − 1.6 and Γ b = 1.0 − 1.3. One possibility <lb/>is that the first terms, (dL s <lb/>i /dT − dL n <lb/>i /dT )| Tc , are negli-<lb/>gible, whence the Lorenz numbers at T c are L a /L 0 ≃ 1.3 <lb/>and L b /L 0 ≃ 0.6. Though L n &gt; L 0 has been predicted <lb/>for strongly correlated systems, 36 these values for L a and <lb/>L b are incompatible with the results of Ref. 8 which im-<lb/>ply L ab ∼ (0.3 − 0.5)L 0 for twinned crystals. The lat-<lb/>ter estimate is consistent with the theoretical analysis <lb/>of Hirschfeld and Putikka, 7 which incorporates inelastic <lb/>spin-fluctuation scattering and parameters constrained to <lb/>fit the normal-state NMR relaxation and electrical resis-<lb/>tivity. We thus conclude that both L a and L b are less <lb/>than L 0 and that the (dL s <lb/>i /dT − dL n <lb/>i /dT )| Tc are nega-<lb/>tive and of comparable magnitude to the second terms <lb/>in Eq. 2. A considerable a/b anisotropy (∼ 2 − 3) in <lb/>the L i , (dL s <lb/>i /dT − dL n <lb/>i /dT )| Tc , or both is then implied. <lb/>Calculations which incorporate inelastic as well as elastic <lb/>scattering to yield the L i (T ) near T c would be useful to <lb/>extract further information from the Γ i . <lb/></body>
