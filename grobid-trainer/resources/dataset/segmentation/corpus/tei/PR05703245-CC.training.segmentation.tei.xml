			<body>I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>Identifying of the pairing symmetry in high-T c superconductors is important to clarify the <lb/>mechanism of the superconductivity. A great deal of experimental and theoretical studies <lb/>have revealed that the superconducting pair potential has d x 2 −y 2 -wave symmetry in the <lb/>bulk state 1-4 . Since the pair potential of the d x 2 −y 2 -wave superconductor is anisotropic, the <lb/>amplitude of the pair potential near the surface or interface is significantly reduced. This <lb/>suppression of the pair potential causes a very interesting phenomena, i.e. the formation of <lb/>Andreev bound state (ABS) at the Fermi energy (zero-energy) near a specularly reflecting <lb/>surface 5 when the angle between the lobe direction of the d x 2 −y 2 -wave pair potential and <lb/>the normal to the interface is nonzero. This state is originated from the interference effect <lb/>in the effective pair potential of the d x 2 −y 2 -wave symmetry through the reflection at the <lb/>surface or interface. The ABS manifests itself as a sharp peak in the middle of the tunneling <lb/>conductance spectra, the so-called zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP), 6 and the consistency <lb/>between theory and experiments has been checked in details 4,7,9-15 . <lb/>On the other hand, there still remains a controversial issue; formation of a broken <lb/>time reversal symmetry state (BTRSS) at low temperature due to the mixing of subdom-<lb/>inant s-, 16-18 or d xy -wave component 19-21 as the imaginary part of the pair potential to <lb/>the predominant d x 2 −y 2 -wave component 25 . Theoretical studies based on the quasiclassical <lb/>approximation 25,26 and several lattice models 28,29 reported the presence of the induced sub-<lb/>dominant pair potential near the surface which breaks the time reversal symmetry 25 . The <lb/>resulting surface density of states with the BTRSS shows the splitting of the zero-energy <lb/>peak 25 and the corresponding tunneling conductance shows the ZBCP splitting. It has also <lb/>been clarified that the magnitude of the splitting depends on the induced subdominant pair <lb/>potential near the surface. Actually, Covington et al. 22 , Krupke et al. 23 , and Sharoni et al. 24 <lb/>reports the ZBCP splitting at low temperature and they ascribed the origin of the ZBCP <lb/>splitting to the above BTRSS 30 . However, at the same time, there are many experiments <lb/>which do not show the ZBCP splitting, and in these experiments, ZBCP survives even at <lb/></body>

			<body>low temperatures 4,12,14,15,13 . Although there are several pre-existing theories which discuss <lb/>the BTRSS 25 , almost all these theories treat the semi-infinite d x 2 −y 2 -wave superconductor <lb/>and the relevance to the actual experiments of tunneling spectroscopy has not been fully <lb/>clarified yet. At this stage, it is an important problem to clarify the stability and the possible <lb/>observability of the formation of BTRSS, i.e., the ZBCP splitting, for various condition of <lb/>the junctions. There are several factors which determine the magnitude of the splitting of <lb/>ZBCP; (i) inter-electron potential which induces the subdominant pair potential near the <lb/>interface, (ii) transmission probability of the particles at the interface, (iii) orientation of <lb/>the junctions, i.e., the angle between the normal to the interface and the crystal axis of <lb/>d x 2 −y 2 -wave superconductor, (iv) finite temperature effect, (v) roughness of the interface 27 , <lb/>and (vi) impurity concentration in the superconductor 31 . <lb/>Although there are several factors which determine the magnitude of the splitting of <lb/>ZBCP, in this paper, we concentrate on (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv). First, we calculate the <lb/>spatial variation of the pair potential in the normal metal / d x 2 −y 2 -wave superconductor <lb/>junction (N/D junction) in the presence of subdominant pair potential using a quasiclassical <lb/>formalism for various conditions of the junctions. Using these results, we calculate tunneling <lb/>conductance. <lb/>The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II, a formulation to calculate the <lb/>spatial dependence of the pair potential, and the tunneling conductance is presented. In <lb/>Sec. III, results of the numerical calculations for both d x 2 −y 2 +is-and d x 2 −y 2 +id xy -wave <lb/>states are discussed in detail. Section IV is devoted to conclusions and future problems. <lb/>II. THEORETICAL FORMULATION <lb/>We study N/D junctions in the clean limit, where the normal metal is located at x &lt; 0 <lb/>and the d x 2 −y 2 -wave superconductor extends elsewhere. For the simplicity, two dimensional <lb/>system is assumed and the x-axis is taken perpendicular to the flat interface located at x = 0. <lb/>When quasiparticles are in the xy-plane, a transmitted electron-like quasiparticle and hole-<lb/></body>

			<body>like quasiparticle feel different effective pair potentials ∆(φ + ) and ∆(φ − ), with φ + = φ and <lb/>φ − = π − φ. Here, φ is the azimuthal angle in the xy-plane given by (k x + ik y )/|k| = e iφ . <lb/>The barrier potential at the interface has a δ-functional form Hδ(x), where δ(x) and H are <lb/>the δ-function and its amplitude, respectively. A cylindrical Fermi surface is assumed and <lb/>the magnitude of the Fermi momentum and the effective mass are chosen to be equal both <lb/>in the normal metal and in the superconductor. <lb/>The quasiclassical Green&apos;s function method 25,26,32-38 developed by Ashida et al. 39,40 is <lb/>used in order to determine the spatial variation of the pair potential self-consistently. In <lb/>the following, we briefly summarize this quasiclassical method we used. We start with the <lb/>Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation for unconventional spin-singlet superconductors 33,41 , <lb/>E nũn (r) = H 0ũn (r) + dr ′ ∆(r, r ′ )ṽ n (r ′ ), <lb/>(1) <lb/>E nṽn (r) = −H 0ṽn (r) + dr ′ ∆ * (r, r ′ )ũ n (r ′ ), <lb/>(2) <lb/>H 0 = −h <lb/>2 <lb/>2m <lb/>∇ 2 − µ, <lb/>(3) <lb/>where µ is the chemical potential, whileũ n (r) andṽ n (r) denote the electron-like and hole-like <lb/>components of the wave function, <lb/>Ψ n (r) = <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>ũ <lb/>n (r) <lb/>v n (r) <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> , <lb/>≡ <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>u n (k, r) <lb/>v n (k, r) <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> e ik F •r = Ψ n (k, r)e ik F •r . <lb/>(4) <lb/>Here the quantitiesk and r stand for the unit vector of the wave number of the Cooper <lb/>pair which is fixed on the Fermi surface (k = k F /|k F |), and the position of the center of <lb/>mass of Cooper pair, respectively. After applying the quasiclassical approximation, the BdG <lb/>equation is reduced to the Andreev equation 5,33,42 , <lb/>E n Ψ n (k, r) = − ihv F k • ∇ +∆(k, r) τ 3 Ψ n (k, r), <lb/>(5) <lb/>∆(k, r) = <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>0 <lb/>∆(k, r) <lb/>−∆ * (k, r) <lb/>0 <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> , <lb/>(6) <lb/></body>

			<body>where v F andτ i (i = 1, 2, 3) stand for Fermi velocity and Pauli matrices, respectively. The <lb/>wave function Ψ n (k, r) is obtained by neglecting the rapidly oscillating plane-wave part <lb/>following the quasiclassical approximation 33,42 . Thek dependence of ∆(k, r) represents the <lb/>symmetry of the pair potential. <lb/>Now, we consider the case where a specularly reflecting surface or interface runs along <lb/>the y-direction. In this case, the pair potential depends only on x since the system is <lb/>homogeneous along the y-direction. It is convenient to introduce the following directional <lb/>notation, 25,39 <lb/>Ψ n (k, r) = Φ (+) <lb/>n (φ + , x)e i|k Fx |x + Φ (−) <lb/>n (φ − , x)e −i|k Fx |x , <lb/>Φ (α) <lb/>n (φ α , x) = <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>u (α) <lb/>n (φ α , x) <lb/>v (α) <lb/>n (φ α , x) <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> . <lb/>(7) <lb/>Here ± represents the sign of the x component of the Fermi wave number k Fx and α(β) = ±. <lb/>We define a Green&apos;s function G αβ (φ, x, x ′ ) and a quasiclassical Green&apos;s function g αβ (φ, x), <lb/>G αβ (φ, x, x ′ ) = <lb/>n <lb/>Φ (α) <lb/>n (φ α , x)Φ (β) † <lb/>n (φ β , x) <lb/>iω m − E n <lb/>, <lb/>(8) <lb/>g αβ (φ, x) ± i(γ 3 ) αβ = −2h|v Fx |τ 3 G αβ (φ, x ± 0, x). <lb/>(9) <lb/>In the above,γ 3 is the Pauli matrix in the directional space 39 and v Fx is the x-component <lb/>of the Fermi velocity. The quasiclassical Green&apos;s function g αβ (φ, x) obeys the Eilenberger <lb/>equation, 32 <lb/>i|v Fx | <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂x <lb/>g αβ (φ, x) = − α iω mτ3 +∆(φ α , x) g αβ (φ, x) <lb/>+ β g αβ (φ, x) iω mτ3 +∆(φ β , x) , <lb/>(10) <lb/>∆(φ α , x) = <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>0 <lb/>∆(φ α , x) <lb/>−∆ * (φ α , x) <lb/>0 <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> , <lb/>(11) <lb/>where ω m is the Matsubara frequency. The quasiclassical Green&apos;s function can be written <lb/>by the following evolution operator U α (φ α , x, x ′ ) as <lb/>g αβ (φ, x) = U α (φ α , x, x ′ )g αβ (φ, x ′ )U −1 <lb/>β (φ β , x, x ′ ), <lb/>(12) <lb/></body>

BROKEN TIME REVERSAL SYMMETRY STATE NEAR AN INTERFACE <lb/>OF A D X 2 −Y 2 -WAVE SUPERCONDUCTOR <lb/>In this section, the spatial dependence of the self-consistently determined pair potential <lb/>and the corresponding tunneling conductance are presented for the d x 2 −y 2 -wave supercon-<lb/>ducting state. In the middle of the d x 2 −y 2 -wave superconductor, the pair potential is given <lb/>by ∆(φ α , ∞) = ∆ 0 cos[2(φ − θ)], where θ is the angle between normal to the interface and <lb/>the lobe direction of the d x 2 −y 2 -wave pair potential, i.e., the angle between the x-axis and <lb/>the crystal a-axis of the d x 2 −y 2 -wave. In this paper, we choose various θ (0 ≤ θ ≤ π/4) by <lb/>changing the magnitude of Z and T s (T dxy ). <lb/>A. d x 2 −y 2 + is-wave state <lb/>In this subsection, we show the spatial dependence of the pair potential and the resulting <lb/>tunneling conductance of the d x 2 −y 2 +is-wave state realized near the interface of the N/D <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>junction. The spatial dependence of the pair potential is expressed as <lb/>∆(φ, x) = ∆ d (x) cos[2(φ − θ)] + ∆ s (x), <lb/>(31) <lb/>where ∆ d (x) and ∆ s (x) correspond to the amplitude of the d x 2 −y 2 -wave and s-wave super-<lb/>conducting states, respectively. The attractive potential V (φ, φ ′ ) is given by <lb/>V (φ, φ ′ ) = 2V d cos[2(φ − θ)] cos[2(φ ′ − θ)] + V s <lb/>(32) <lb/>where V d and V s denote the attractive potential of predominant d x 2 −y 2 -wave and subdomi-<lb/>nant s-wave, respectively, and they are given as <lb/>V d = <lb/>2πk B T <lb/>log <lb/>T <lb/>T c <lb/>+ <lb/>0≤m&lt;ωc/2πT <lb/>1 <lb/>m + 1/2 <lb/>, <lb/>(33) <lb/>V s = <lb/>2πk B T <lb/>log <lb/>T <lb/>T s <lb/>+ <lb/>0≤m&lt;ωc/2πT <lb/>1 <lb/>m + 1/2 <lb/>. <lb/>(34) <lb/>Here, T s denotes the transition temperature of s-wave component of the pair potential <lb/>without predominant d x 2 −y 2 -wave component. For θ = 0 or θ = π/4, only Re[∆ d (x)] <lb/>and Im[∆ s (x)] are nonzero. The spatial dependence of the pair potentials Re[∆ d (x)] and <lb/>Im[∆ s (x)] is plotted in Fig. 1(a) for various θ with T s /T d = 0.2 and Z = 3. The x-axis of <lb/>Fig. 1(a) is normalized by ξ 0 =hv F /∆ 0 which is the coherence length of the superconductor. <lb/>For θ = 0 [(100) surface], since Im[∆ s (x)] = 0 is satisfied, the time reversal symmetry is not <lb/>broken and the amplitude of Re[∆ d (x)] is not suppressed at the interface. By changing the <lb/>angle θ from zero, the magnitude of Re[∆ d (x)] is reduced near the interface, while Im[∆ s (x)] <lb/>is induced at the interface 25 . The suppression of Re[∆ d (x)] is originated from a depairing <lb/>effect that the effective pair potentials ∆(φ + , 0) and ∆(φ − , 0) have reversed contribution to <lb/>the pairing interaction for certain range of φ for θ = 0. When Re[∆ d (x)] is suppressed at <lb/>the interface, the quasiparticle forms the ABS near the interface at zero-energy 5 . The ABS <lb/>is unstable with the introduction of s-wave attractive potential, then Im[∆ s (x)] is induced <lb/>at the interface 25 . The magnitude of Im[∆ s (x)] becomes maximum at θ = π/4, where the <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

		<body>above suppression effect is most significant. In Fig. 1(b), Re[∆ d (x)] and Im[∆ s (x)] are plot-<lb/>ted for various Z with T s /T d = 0.2 and θ = π/4. Even if the BTRSS becomes to be most <lb/>stable at θ = π/4, when the height of barrier is small, the magnitude of the subdominant <lb/>imaginary component of ∆ s (x) is not induced at all. The induced imaginary component of <lb/>∆ s (x) is enhanced with the increase of Z. <lb/>The spatial dependence of the pair potentials near the interface with the intermediate <lb/>angle (θ = π/6) is shown in Fig. 2 for various height of barrier. In such a case, both <lb/>Im[∆ d (x)] and Re[∆ s (x)] becomes nonzero and the spatial dependence is much more complex <lb/>as compared to that for θ = 0 or θ = π/4. The amplitudes of Im[∆ d (x)], Re[∆ s (x)], and <lb/>Im[∆ s (x)] are enhanced for larger magnitude of Z, where the suppression of Re[∆ d (x)] is <lb/>significant. However, the amplitudes of Im[∆ d (x)] and Re[∆ s (x)] are one order smaller than <lb/>that of Im[∆ s (x)]. <lb/>Next, we look at the magnitude of subdominant components of the pair potential at <lb/>the interface, Im[∆ s (0)], Im[∆ d (0)], and Re[∆ s (0)], for various T s , Z, and θ. As shown in <lb/>Fig. 3(a), the magnitude of Im[∆ s (0)] increases monotonically with T s for fixed θ and Z, <lb/>and it is enhanced for larger magnitude of Z. In other words, the amplitude of Im[∆ s (0)] is <lb/>sensitive to the transmission probability of the junctions. In Fig. 3(b), Im[∆ s (0)] is plotted <lb/>as a function of θ for sufficiently larger magnitude of Z(= 5.0). For θ = 0, i.e., junction <lb/>with (100) interface, the magnitude of Im[∆ s (0)] is negligibly small near the interface even <lb/>at the larger magnitude of T s . The magnitude of Im[∆ s (0)] is a monotonically increasing <lb/>function with the increase of θ and has a maximum at θ = π/4. As seen from Figs. 3(c) and <lb/>3(d), both the magnitude of Im[∆ d (0)] and Re[∆ s (0)] is enhanced and has a maximum at a <lb/>certain θ. In the intermediate θ, i.e., θ = 0 or θ = π/4, the magnitude of ∆(φ + , x) and that <lb/>of ∆(φ − , x) does not coincide any more, the interference with the quasiparticle and the pair <lb/>potential becomes complex. Then, not only Im[∆ s (0)] but also Re[∆ s (0)] and Im[∆ d (0)] <lb/>become nonzero. <lb/>Using self-consistently determined pair potentials, let us look at the normalized tunneling <lb/>conductance σ T (eV ). In order to clarify the temperature T dependence of σ T (eV ), we choose <lb/></body>

Only for θ = 0, line <lb/>shape of σ T (eV ) is similar to that of the bulk density of states of d x 2 −y 2 -wave superconducting <lb/>state. In other cases, σ T (eV ) has a zero bias enhanced line shape. As clarified in previous <lb/>literatures 4 , when θ deviates from zero, since the injected and reflected quasiparticles have <lb/>a chance to feel the sign change of the pair potentials, zero-energy ABS is formed at the <lb/>interface. This zero-energy ABS causes the ZBCP when the magnitude of T s is small. With <lb/>the increase of the magnitude of T s , the zero energy ABS is unstable and s-wave subdominant <lb/>component is induced which breaks time reversal symmetry and it blocks the motion of the <lb/>quasiparticles. Then, the energy levels of bound state shift from zero and the local density <lb/>of states has a zero-energy peak splitting. The resulting σ T (eV ) has a ZBCP splitting as <lb/>shown in Fig. 4(b). However, with the increase of T , the slight splitting of ZBCP fades out <lb/>due to smearing effect by finite temperature and the resulting σ T (eV ) has a rather broad <lb/>ZBCP [see Fig. 4(c) and Fig. 4(d)]. <lb/>Next, we concentrate on how σ T (eV ) is influenced by the transmission probability of the <lb/>junctions, i.e., the magnitude of Z. In Fig. 5, σ T (eV ) with θ = π/4 is plotted for T = 0 (left <lb/>panels) and T = 0.05T c (right panels). For the junctions with high transmissivity, σ T (eV ) <lb/>has a ZBCP, [see Fig. 5(a)] and the magnitude of σ T (0) is firstly enhanced with the increase <lb/>of Z. In this case, the predominant d x 2 −y 2 -wave component only exists near the interface as <lb/>shown in Fig. 1(b). However, with the increase of Z, σ T (eV ) starts to have a ZBCP splitting <lb/>at a certain value of Z, where the magnitude of subdominant component Im[∆ s (x)] at the <lb/>interface becomes the same order as that of the predominant component Re[∆ d (x)]. For <lb/>sufficiently larger magnitude of Z, σ T (eV ) has a ZBCP splitting, [see Fig. 5(b) and 5(c),] <lb/>and the magnitude of σ T (0) decreases with the increase of Z. However, the above obtained <lb/>results are influenced by finite temperature effect. The right panels of Fig. 5 is shown <lb/>for the tunneling conductance in T /T c = 0.05. The slight enhanced structure of σ T (eV ) <lb/>at eV = ±∆ 0 in Fig. 5(a), 5(b), and 5(c) is invisible due to the smearing effect by finite <lb/>temperature [see Fig. 5(c), 5(d), and 5(e)]. With the increase of the magnitude of Z, σ T (eV ) <lb/>has a ZBCP with tiny dip even at Z = 2.5, where the order of the amplitude of Im[∆ s (0)] is <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>0.2∆ 0 . With the further increase of Z, σ T (eV ) has a ZBCP splitting [see Fig. 5(f)], however <lb/>the degree of the splitting is significantly weakened as compared to the corresponding curves <lb/>in Fig. 5(c). <lb/>Finally, we look at the relation between the position of the splitted peak and the mag-<lb/>nitude of Im[∆ s (0)]. In Fig. 6(a), σ T (eV ) is plotted for various T s with Z = 5 and T = 0. <lb/>As shown in Fig. 3(b), the magnitude of the induced subdominant imaginary component of <lb/>Im[∆ s (0)] is about 0.16∆ 0 , 0.3∆ 0 , and 0.42∆ 0 for T s /T d = 0.1, T s /T d = 0.3 and T s /T d = 0.5, <lb/>respectively. The corresponding σ T (eV ) has a splitted peak locating at ±0.16∆ 0 , ±0.3∆ 0 , <lb/>and ±0.42∆ 0 , respectively. With the increase of T , the height of these peaks are drastically <lb/>suppressed as shown in Fig. 6(b). Finally, we show how the line shape of σ T (eV ) changes <lb/>at the temperature T = Ts (Ts = 0.12T c ) where Im[∆ s (x)] becomes nonzero. As seen from <lb/>Fig. 6(c), the magnitude of σ T (0) is reduced with the introduction of Im[∆ s (x)]. <lb/>At the end of this subsection, we can summarize that even in the presence of BTRSS, the <lb/>resulting σ T (eV ) does not always have a clear ZBCP splitting due to the finite temperature <lb/>effect when the magnitude of the transmission probability of the junctions is not low. <lb/>B. d x 2 −y 2 +id xy -wave state <lb/>In this subsection, we study spatial dependence of the pair potentials of the d x 2 −y 2 +id xy -<lb/>wave state and the resulting tunneling conductance in N/D junctions. The pair potential is <lb/>given by <lb/>∆(φ, x) = ∆ d (x) cos[2(φ − θ)] + ∆ dxy (x) sin[2(φ − θ)], <lb/>(35) <lb/>where ∆ dxy (x) is an amplitude of the d xy -wave superconducting state and a complex number. <lb/>The attractive inter-electron potential V (φ, φ ′ ) is given by <lb/>V (φ, φ ′ ) = 2V d cos[2(φ − θ)] cos[2(φ ′ − θ)] + 2V dxy sin[2(φ − θ)] sin[2(φ ′ − θ)], <lb/>(36) <lb/>where V d and V dxy stand for the attractive potential of predominant d x 2 −y 2 -wave and sub-<lb/>dominant d xy -wave, respectively, and they are given as <lb/></body>

			<body>V d = <lb/>2πk B T <lb/>log <lb/>T <lb/>T c <lb/>+ <lb/>0≤m&lt;ωc/2πT <lb/>1 <lb/>m + 1/2 <lb/>, <lb/>(37) <lb/>V dxy = <lb/>2πk B T <lb/>log <lb/>T <lb/>T dxy <lb/>+ <lb/>0≤m&lt;ωc/2πT <lb/>1 <lb/>m + 1/2 <lb/>. <lb/>(38) <lb/>The spatial dependence of the pair potentials with a finite transmissivity for Z = 3.0 and <lb/>θ = π/4 is shown in Fig. 7(a). As in the case for d x 2 −y 2 +is-wave state, the amplitude of <lb/>Im[∆ dxy (x)] vanishes at θ = 0. For θ = π/4, the suppression of the magnitude of Re[∆ d (x)] is <lb/>most significant, while ∆ dxy (x) is induced at the interface. At this θ, the d xy -wave component <lb/>is not affected by depairing effect seriously since the lobe direction of d xy -wave pair potential <lb/>is parallel or perpendicular to the interface as in the case for predominant d x 2 −y 2 -wave with <lb/>θ = 0. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the amplitude of Im[∆ dxy (x)] is enhanced with the increase of <lb/>Z. <lb/>The spatial dependencies of Re[∆ d (x)], Im[∆ d (x)], Re[∆ s (x)], and Im[∆ s (x)] are plotted <lb/>in Figs. 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), and 8(d), respectively, with the intermediate θ (θ = π/6) for various <lb/>Z. In such a case, the spatial dependence is much more complex as compared to that for <lb/>θ = 0 or θ = π/4, and both Im[∆ d (x)] and Re[∆ dxy (x)] become nonzero. The amplitudes <lb/>of Im[∆ d (x)], Re[∆ dxy (x)], and Im[∆ s (x)] are enhanced for larger magnitude of Z, where <lb/>the suppression of Re[∆ d (x)] is significant. The remarkable feature is that the amplitude of <lb/>Im[∆ d (x)] and Re[∆ dxy (x)] can become the same order of Im[∆ s (x)] for larger Z. <lb/>Next, we look at the magnitude of subdominant components of the pair potential at <lb/>the interface, Im[∆ dxy (0)], Im[∆ d (0)], and Re[∆ dxy (0)] for various parameters T dxy , Z and θ <lb/>shown in Fig. 9. The magnitude of Im[∆ dxy (0)] increases monotonically with T dxy for fixed <lb/>θ and Z. It is also enhanced for larger magnitude of Z. Comparing the corresponding <lb/>situation of d x 2 −y 2 + is-wave shown in Fig. 3(a), the magnitude of Im[∆ dxy (0)] is suppressed <lb/>for the small magnitude of T dxy . In Fig. 9(b), Im[∆ dxy (0)] is plotted as a function of θ for <lb/>sufficiently larger magnitude of Z(= 5.0). The magnitude of Im[∆ dxy (0)] is a monotonically <lb/>increasing function with the increase of θ and has a maximum at θ = π/4. The amplitudes of <lb/></body>

			<body>Im[∆ d (0)] and Re[∆ dxy (0)] are negligibly small for θ = 0 and θ = π/4, and has a maximum <lb/>at a certain θ as shown in Figs. 9(c) and 9(d), respectively. <lb/>The resulting normalized tunneling conductance σ T (eV ) is plotted in Figs. 10(a) and <lb/>10(b) with T = 0 and the corresponding quantities with T = 0.05T c is plotted in Figs. 10(c) <lb/>and 10(d) for various θ. Only for θ = 0, line shape of σ T (eV ) is similar to that of the bulk <lb/>density of states of d x 2 −y 2 -wave superconducting state. In other cases, σ T (eV ) has a zero-bias <lb/>enhanced line shape due to the formation of ABS [see Fig. 4(a)]. The ABS causes the ZBCP <lb/>when the magnitude of T dxy is small. However, with the increase of the magnitude of T dxy , the <lb/>zero-energy ABS is unstable and subdominant d xy -wave component is induced. The energy <lb/>levels of bound state shifts from zero and the local density of states has a zero-energy peak <lb/>splitting. The resulting σ T (eV ) has a ZBCP splitting as shown in Fig. 10(b). As compared <lb/>to the case of d x 2 −y 2 +is state, the magnitude of σ T (0) is not reduced seriously since the <lb/>effective d xy -wave pair potential felt by quasiparticles is distributed from −Im[∆ dxy (0)] to <lb/>Im[∆ dxy (0)]. With the increase of temperature, the ZBCP splitting is not visible any more. <lb/>[see Fig. 10(c) and Fig. 10(d)]. <lb/>Next, we concentrate on how σ T (eV ) is influenced by the transmissivity of the junctions, <lb/>i.e., the magnitude of Z. In Fig. 11, σ T (eV ) with θ = π/4 is plotted for T = 0 (left <lb/>panels) and T = 0.05T c (right panels). As shown in Fig. 11, σ T (eV ) with θ = π/4 depends <lb/>on the transmissivity of the junction crucially. For the junctions with high transmissivity, <lb/>σ T (eV ) has a ZBCP [see Fig. 11(a)] and the magnitude of σ T (0) is firstly enhanced with <lb/>the increase of Z. In this case, only the predominant d x 2 −y 2 -wave component exists near <lb/>the interface as shown in Fig. 1(b). However, with the increase of Z, σ T (eV ) starts to have <lb/>a peak splitting at a certain value of Z, where the magnitude of the induced subdominant <lb/>component at the interface Im[∆ dxy (0)] overlaps that of the predominant one Re[∆ d (x)]. For <lb/>sufficiently larger magnitude of Z, σ T (eV ) has a ZBCP splitting [see Figs. 11(b) and 11(c)] <lb/>and the magnitude of σ T (0) decreases with the increase of Z. The right panels of Fig. 11 <lb/>are shown for the σ T (eV ) with finite temperature. Only for the junctions with the lowest <lb/>transmissivity (Z = 5), the subtle splitting of ZBCP appears in σ T (eV ). For T = 0.05T C , <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>similar line shapes of σ T (eV ) with smeared ZBCP splitting are obtained [see Fig. 11(d), <lb/>Fig. 11(e) and Fig. 11(f)]. However, the slight enhanced structure of σ T (eV ) at eV = ±∆ 0 <lb/>vanishes. <lb/>Finally, we look at the relation between the position of the splitted peak and the magni-<lb/>tude of Im[∆ dxy (0)]. In Fig. 12(a), we show T dxy dependence of the tunneling conductance <lb/>spectra σ T (eV ) for θ = 0 with Z = 5. As shown in Fig. 9(b), the magnitude of the induced <lb/>subdominant imaginary component of Im[∆ dxy (0)] is about 0.15∆ 0 , 0.35∆ 0 , and 0.52∆ 0 for <lb/>T dxy /T d = 0.1, T dxy /T d = 0.3 and T dxy /T d = 0.5, respectively. The corresponding σ T (eV ) <lb/>has a splitted peak locating at ±0.16∆ 0 , ±0.3∆ 0 , and ±0.42∆ 0 , respectively. The width of <lb/>the two splitted peaks depends on the temperature as shown in Fig. 12(b). Next, we show <lb/>how the line shape of σ T (eV ) changes at the temperature T = Td <lb/>xy [Td <lb/>xy = 0.07T c ] where <lb/>Im[∆ dxy (x)] becomes nonzero. As seen from Fig. 12(c), the magnitude of σ T (0) is reduced <lb/>with the introduction of Im[∆ s (x)]. <lb/>At the end of this section, we can summarize that even in the presence of BTRSS, the <lb/>resulting σ T (eV ) does not always have a clear ZBCP splitting due to the finite temperature <lb/>effect when the transmission probability of the particles at the interface is not low. In <lb/>order to observe the ZBCP splitting which is one of the evidence supporting BTRSS, we <lb/>must measure σ T (eV ) for the junctions with low transmissivity with (110) oriented interface <lb/>(θ = π/4) at low temperatures. In such a case, we can classify the the d x 2 −y 2 +is-and <lb/>d x 2 −y 2 +id xy -wave state through the magnitude of σ T (0) and the width of the ZBCP splitting <lb/>for the junctions with low transmission probability. <lb/>IV. CONCLUSION <lb/>In this paper, spatial dependence of the pair potential in the N/D junctions is determined <lb/>on the basis of the quasiclassical theory in the presence of subdominant component of the <lb/>pair potential near the interface. We clarified the influence of the spatial variation of the <lb/>pair potentials on the tunneling conductance spectra for various conditions of the junctions. <lb/></body>

			<body>We selected two kinds of subdominant components s-and d xy -wave which are induced as <lb/>d x 2 −y 2 +is-and d x 2 −y 2 +id xy -wave state, respectively. The amplitude of ∆ s (x) [∆ dxy (x)] is <lb/>enhanced with the increase of the magnitude of Z, T s [T dxy ], and θ (0 &lt; θ &lt; π/4). In the <lb/>intermediate θ, both Im[∆ d (x)] and Re[∆ s (x)] {Re[∆ dxy ]} becomes nonzero, although these <lb/>magnitudes are small as compared to those of Re[∆ d (x)] and Im[∆ s (x)] {Im[∆ dxy ]}. The <lb/>resulting σ T (eV ) depends on Z, T s (or T dxy ), and θ. For fixed Z, the magnitude of σ T (0) <lb/>increases with the increase of θ (0 &lt; θ &lt; π/4) for small magnitude of T s /T d [T dxy /T d ]. <lb/>While σ T (0) increases and decreases again with the increase of θ (0 &lt; θ &lt; π/4) due to the <lb/>formation of d x 2 −y 2 +is-[d x 2 −y 2 +id xy ]-wave state for sufficiently larger magnitude of T s /T d <lb/>[T dxy /T d ]. For fixed θ and T s /T d [T dxy /T d ], σ T (eV ) has a ZBCP for small magnitude of Z, <lb/>while it has a ZBCP splitting for sufficiently larger magnitude of Z. Using junctions with <lb/>small transmissivity, we can distinguish d x 2 −y 2 +is-wave state from d x 2 −y 2 +id xy -wave state <lb/>since the magnitude of σ T (0) for d x 2 −y 2 +is-wave state is much more reduced as compared <lb/>to that for d x 2 −y 2 +id xy -wave state as seen from Fig. 4 [Fig. 6] to Fig. 10 [Fig. 12]. By taking <lb/>into account finite temperature effect, the degree of the ZBCP splitting is suppressed and <lb/>the fine structure at eV ∼ ∆ 0 in σ T (eV ) becomes invisible. <lb/>In the light of our theory, one of the reason for the absence of ZBCP splitting for many <lb/>tunneling experiments may be due to their high transmissivity of the junctions (small mag-<lb/>nitude of Z) and high temperatures. If we choose T c as 90K, unless the transmissivity of the <lb/>junction is sufficiently low, it is difficult to observe ZBCP splitting clearly at 4.5K. In order <lb/>to see the ZBCP splitting clearly, we must observe much more low temperature (T &lt; 4.5K) <lb/>using a clean junctions with low transmissivity for θ = π/4. <lb/>In this paper, we have chosen a free electron model with cylindrical Fermi surfaces. In <lb/>order to compare actual tunneling conductance, we must calculate spatial dependence of the <lb/>pair potential and the tunneling conductance by taking into account of the actual shape of <lb/>Fermi surface. For this purpose, it is a promising way to perform the calculation based on the <lb/>t-J model with Gutzwiller approximation 44 , where the doping dependence is naturally taken <lb/>into account. Using this model, we succeeded to explain detailed line shape of the scanning <lb/></body>

As regards quasiparticle states near <lb/>the interface, the pre-existing calculations are performed for infinite barrier limit 10,28,29 . In <lb/>order to compare actual tunneling experiments, we must calculate the N/D junctions based <lb/>on the t-J model using Gutzwiller approximation. In the t-J model, the subdominant d xy -<lb/>wave component is hard to be realized 44 since a nearest neighbor attractive potential is taken <lb/>into account. In order to discuss the d xy -wave component, we must consider much more long <lb/>range interaction including three site hopping term. <lb/>It is also revealed by recent theory that the BTRSS influences significantly on the Joseph-<lb/>son effect 48-50 . The previous theory assumes a sufficient larger magnitude of barrier 50 . In <lb/>order to compare the existing experiments, we must calculate Josephson current in the <lb/>presence of BTRSS for arbitrary transmissivity of the junctions. <lb/></body>
