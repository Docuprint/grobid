			<body>temperature change of a magnetic material when exposed to a magnetic field. This effect <lb/>is an intrinsic property of the material and occurs due to the change in the degree of <lb/>alignment of the magnetic moments in the magnetic sublattice of the system under the <lb/>influence of an applied magnetic field. The concept of magnetic refrigeration, which is <lb/>based on MCE, has attracted a great deal of attention from a large group of researchers <lb/>and has triggered an intensive search for compounds with large MCE. Generally, due to <lb/>their large magnetic moments, heavy rare earth elements and their compounds are <lb/>considered the best-suited materials for achieving large MCE. After the observation 1 of a <lb/>giant MCE in Gd 5 Si 2 Ge 2 and the studies on the pseudo-binary systems 8 like R 5 (Si x Ge 1-x ) 4 <lb/>with R= La, Lu, Nd and Dy, much interest has been focused on the compounds showing <lb/>field-induced magnetic phase transitions and/or structural transitions. But the <lb/>magnetocaloric studies in MnFeP 1-x As x system 9 has shown that large MCE is not just <lb/>restricted to the compounds with large magnetic moments but depends strongly on the <lb/>type of magnetic/structural phase transitions as well. It has already been reported that <lb/>single crystals of some RNi (R=Dy, Er) compounds undergo field-induced spin flop <lb/>process, which results in metamagnetic transitions in their magnetization-field <lb/>isotherms 10 . It would be of interest to see whether such a spin-flop process is reflected in <lb/>the magnetization behavior in the polycrystalline samples as well and also its influence <lb/>on the MCE. With this view, we have carried out the magnetic and magnetocaloric <lb/>studies on the compound DyNi and the results are presented here. <lb/>2. Experimental details <lb/>The polycrystalline sample of DyNi was prepared by arc melting stoichiometric <lb/>proportions of the starting materials (of at least 99.9% purity) on a water-cooled copper <lb/>hearth under high purity argon atmosphere. The ingots were melted several times and <lb/>subsequently annealed at 600°C in evacuated quartz tube to ensure phase formation and <lb/>homogeneity. The crystal structure and the phase purity of the sample were analyzed <lb/>from the Rietveld refinement of the powder x-ray diffraction data. Magnetization <lb/></body>

			<body>measurements, in the temperature range 4-150 K and up to a maximum field of 120 kOe, <lb/>were carried out on pieces of the annealed sample using a vibrating sample magnetometer <lb/>(VSM, Oxford instruments). Heat capacity measurements, in the temperature range 2-<lb/>200 K and in magnetic fields up to 50 kOe, were performed using a relaxation method <lb/>(PPMS, Quantum Design). While the isothermal magnetic entropy change has been <lb/>calculated independently using the magnetization isotherms as well as the heat capacity <lb/>data, the adiabatic temperature change has been estimated using the heat capacity data. <lb/>3. Results and discussion <lb/>The Rietveld analysis of the powder x-ray diffractogram of the polycrystalline sample of <lb/>DyNi showed that this compound is single phase crystallizing in the orthorhombic FeB <lb/>structure (space group Pnma, no. 62) 11-12 <lb/>. Figure 1 shows the observed and refined <lb/>powder x-ray diffractogram of DyNi. The lattice parameters obtained from the refinement <lb/>are <lb/>3±0.001 Å, b <lb/>3±0.001 Å and c = 5.439±0.001 Å which compare well <lb/>with the reported values <lb/>02 <lb/>. <lb/>7 <lb/>= <lb/>a <lb/>17 <lb/>. <lb/>4 <lb/>= <lb/>11 . Both Dy and Ni occupy the 4c site of the unit cell. The <lb/>structure is made up of trigonal prisms with Dy at the corners and Ni at the center. <lb/>Fig 1.

			<body>Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetization (M) of DyNi, <lb/>measured in a field of 500 Oe. It is seen that the compound is ferromagnetic with a Curie <lb/>temperature (T C ) of 59 K, which is close to the reported value 12 . The inverse <lb/>susceptibility derived from the magnetization data is presented in the inset of figure 2. <lb/>The effective magnetic moment (µ eff ) calculated from the high temperature susceptibility <lb/>is found to be 10.6µ B , which is almost equal to the free ion magnetic moment of 10.3 µ B <lb/>of the Dy 3+ ion. Figure 3 shows the variation of magnetization for both increasing and <lb/>decreasing magnetic fields (H) at 4 K. Interestingly, the magnetization shows a multi-<lb/>step behavior, which is a characteristic of metamagnetic transitions. It is of importance to <lb/>note that generally such sharp transitions are seen in metamagnetic systems in the single <lb/>crystalline form. To confirm the existence of these steps, we have measured the M-H at 5 <lb/>K also and the plot is shown in the inset of figure 3. These plots also show that the <lb/>magnetization is not saturated even at the highest field applied and the remanence is <lb/>almost negligible. <lb/>It has been reported 10 from the magnetization studies in single crystals of DyNi that when <lb/>the applied field is along the c-axis, the magnetization is very small at lower fields, but <lb/>rises sharply above a critical field. This gives rise to a step-like behavior, accompanied by <lb/>a large hysteresis. The critical field is reported to be about 50 kOe at 4.2 K. Both the <lb/>critical field and the hysteresis decrease with increase of temperature. Neutron diffraction <lb/>studies 12 carried out at 4.2 K on powder samples have shown that the magnetic structure <lb/>of DyNi is non-collinear. While the moments are ferromagnetically coupled along the a-<lb/>axis, they are antiferroimagnetically coupled along the c-axis. The non-collinear magnetic <lb/>structure of DyNi arises from the compromise between the exchange interaction and the <lb/>magnetocrystalline anisotropy caused by the crystalline electric fields. The <lb/>antiferromagnetic component is expected to undergo a spin flopping on application of a <lb/>magnetic field along the c-axis, which gives rise to a sudden increase in the <lb/>magnetization. Therefore, we feel that the multi-step behavior of the M-H plot in the <lb/>polycrystalline DyNi in the present case is also due to the spin-flop metamagnetism. <lb/>However, while the single crystal data showed a single jump, our data on polycrystalline <lb/>sample show multiple jumps. A similar behavior in the M-H isotherms has been observed <lb/></body>

The lower <lb/>value in the present case may be due to the crystal field effects. Figure 4 shows the <lb/>magnetization as a function of applied field at different temperatures close to T C . It is <lb/>clear from figures 3 and 4 that the magnetization behaves like that in a simple <lb/>ferromagnet and that the remanence is quite negligible, which indicates that the <lb/>compound is magnetically soft. <lb/>Fig. 2 Temperature (T) dependence of the magnetization (M) of DyNi in a field of 500 <lb/>Oe.

Figure 6 shows the temperature variation of heat capacity in applied fields of 0, 20 <lb/>kOe and 50 kOe. It is seen from this figure that the heat capacity also shows a peak close <lb/>to 59 K, which is the Curie temperature derived from the M-T data. The peak height <lb/>decreases with increase in field, and for a field of 50 kOe, practically, there is no peak in <lb/>the C-T plot. This is because the magnetic ordering starts at temperatures slightly above <lb/>T C when the applied field is large, thereby broadening the heat capacity peak. <lb/></body>

			<body>Jkg -1 K -1 whereas the corresponding value from the magnetization isotherms is about 18 <lb/>Jkg -1 K -1 for the same field change of 50 kOe. This difference may be due to the different <lb/>temperature steps (δT) used for the magnetization and heat capacity measurements. <lb/>Since the numerical integration depends on δT, the values of ∆S M calculated from the M-<lb/>H-T and C-H-T data are also expected to show a difference, as seen in the present case. <lb/>It is of interest to note that the ∆S M and ∆T ad values obtained for DyNi are comparable to <lb/>those of many potential magnetic refrigerant materials 2,3,15 . Moreover, the temperature <lb/>range over which the MCE is considerable is also wide, which is essential for a practical <lb/>magnetic refrigerant. The large MCE values in DyNi can be attributed to its <lb/>metamagnetic nature mentioned earlier. It is possible that the gradual flopping of <lb/>moments towards the direction of the applied field is responsible for the reduction in <lb/>magnetic entropy, which results in MCE. Spin flop process has also been found to be <lb/>responsible for the anomalous magnetoresistance observed along the c-axis in single <lb/>crystals of DyNi 16 . <lb/>4. Conclusions <lb/>In conclusion, we find that the compound DyNi, in the polycrystalline form, shows a <lb/>multi-step magnetization behavior, indicating its metamagnetic nature. Large values of <lb/>isothermal magnetic entropy change and adiabatic temperature change existing over a <lb/>wide temperature range make this system attractive from the point of view of magnetic <lb/>refrigeration applications in the temperature range 50-80 K. The fact that the compound <lb/>is magnetically soft is another advantage of this material. <lb/></body>
