India <lb/>Though the superconducting phase of the type-II Dirac semimetal PdTe2 was shown to be con-<lb/>ventional in nature, the phase continued to be interesting in terms of its magnetic properties. While <lb/>certain experiments indicated an unexpected type-I superconducting phase, other experiments re-<lb/>vealed formation of vortices under the application of magnetic fields. Recently, scanning tunneling <lb/>spectroscopy (STS) experiments revealed the existence of a mixed phase where type-I and type-II <lb/>behaviours coexist. Here, based on our temperature and magnetic field dependent STS experiments <lb/>on Cu-intercalated PdTe2 we show that as the critical temperature of the superconducting phase <lb/>goes up from 1.7 K to 2.4 K on Cu-intercalation, the mixed phase disappears and the system be-<lb/>comes homogeneously type-II. This may be attributed to an averaging effect caused by quasiparticle <lb/>exchange between type-I and type-II domains mediated by the Cu atoms and to decreased coherence <lb/>length due to increased disorder. <lb/></front>

		<body>The candidate type II Dirac semimetal PdTe 2 [1-3] <lb/>superconducts below 1.7 K [4-8]. Though initial experi-<lb/>mental papers suggested the possibility of an unconven-<lb/>tional nature of the superconducting phase of PdTe 2 , a <lb/>number of experiments confirmed that the superconduc-<lb/>tivity in PdTe 2 is conventional in nature [9, 10]. How-<lb/>ever, some of these experiments found evidence of type <lb/>I behaviour as far as the magnetic properties of the su-<lb/>perconducting phase of PdTe 2 are concerned [4, 11, 12]. <lb/>These contradicted with certain other experiments where <lb/>the magnetic properties were found to be consistent with <lb/>type II superconductivity [13]. More recently, magnetic <lb/>field dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy exper-<lb/>iments revealed coexistence of type I and type II do-<lb/>mains in PdTe 2 where such an inhomogeneity of the su-<lb/>perconducting phase was attributed to electronic inho-<lb/>mogeneities observed in the normal state of PdTe 2 [14]. <lb/>It turned out that the electronic inhomogeneity could <lb/>alter the local electron density and the local coherence <lb/>length thereby leading to a distribution of the Ginzburg-<lb/>Landau-Abrikosov-Gorkov (GLAG) parameter (κ) over <lb/>the surface of PdTe 2 [15]. Within this picture, it should <lb/>be possible to disorder the system so that inter-domain <lb/>scattering of the quasiparticles can average out the κ dis-<lb/>tribution and make the system homogeneous. In this pa-<lb/>per, we report the observation of such averaging effect <lb/>in Cu-PdTe 2 by magnetic field dependent scanning tun-<lb/>neling spectroscopy experiments. The superconducting <lb/>phase becomes homogeneously type II while the critical <lb/>temperature gets enhanced at randomly distributed do-<lb/>mains on the surface due to random distribution of the <lb/>intercalates . <lb/>The effect of Cu-intercalation on the electrical and <lb/>thermal transport properties in PdTe 2 was investigated <lb/>in detail in the past [16, 17]. Such measurements on <lb/>polycrystalline samples indicated that the higher T c in <lb/>Cu-PdTe 2 is due to enhanced electron-phonon coupling <lb/></body>

		<body>parameter (λ ph ) and increased density of states upon Cu-<lb/>intercalation[18]. For the spectroscopic measurements <lb/>presented in this paper we used high quality single crys-<lb/>tals of Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 with 4% Cu in the crys-<lb/>tals. The shiny single crystals were first mounted in a <lb/>ultra-high vacuum (UHV) cleaving stage integrated with <lb/>the STM. The crystals were then cleaved at 80 K us-<lb/>ing a cleaver attached to an UHV manipulator. After <lb/>cleaving, the crystals were immediately transferred to <lb/>the STM head which is cooled down to 310 mK using <lb/>a H 3 -based cryostat. The sample is placed at the center <lb/>of a solenoidal superconducting magnet with a maximum <lb/>field strength of 11 Tesla. All the STM/S experiments re-<lb/>ported in this paper were performed with sharp metallic <lb/>tips of tungsten (W). The tips were fabricated by electro-<lb/>chemical etching and were cleaned by electron beam bom-<lb/>bardment under UHV in a preparation chamber attached <lb/>to the STM prior to the low temperature experiments. <lb/>The formation of the superconducting phase with T c = <lb/>2.6 K is seen in the susceptibility versus temperature data <lb/>presented in Figure 1(b). <lb/>In Figure 1(a), we show an atomic resolution image <lb/>of the surface of Cu-PdTe 2 . A careful inspection of this <lb/>image reveals two types of defects -(i) triangular defects <lb/>as in PdTe 2 and typical for chalcogenides and (ii) dark <lb/>spots surrounded by well defined patterns. While (i) were <lb/>seen in non-intercalated PdTe 2 , (ii) are new and therefore <lb/>originate from the intercalated Cu atoms. Clear image <lb/>of the lattice captured from a defect-free region is shown <lb/>in the inset of Figure 1(a). The patterns formed around <lb/>the Cu atoms could be an interference pattern caused by <lb/>incoming quasiparticles and their counterparts scattered <lb/>from the Cu atoms. We have investigated the energy <lb/>dependence of such patterns in detail and found that the <lb/>pattern does not disperse with energy. Hence, the states <lb/>participating in formation of the patterns are most likely <lb/>topologically trivial surface states. <lb/>The scanning tunnelling spectroscopy revealed two <lb/>types of spectra. One type captured at 310 mK is <lb/>shown as a blue line in Figure 1(c). The coherence <lb/>peaks are clearly seen below which the differential con-<lb/></body>

(c,d) two representative STS <lb/>spectra with best theoretical fits <lb/>ductance becomes zero indicating formation of a full gap <lb/>[19], as expected for BCS superconductor. The spec-<lb/>trum is fitted using Dyne&apos;s equation given by N s (E) = <lb/>Re <lb/>(E−iΓ) <lb/>√ <lb/>(E−iΓ) 2 −∆ 2 , where N s (E) is the density of states <lb/>at energy E, ∆ is the superconducting energy gap and, Γ <lb/>is an effective broadening parameter incorporated to take <lb/>care of slight broadening of the BCS density of states <lb/>possibly due to finite quasi-particle life time [20]. For <lb/>the type of spectra shown in Figure 1(c), the extracted <lb/>value of ∆ is 0.53 meV. To note, the experimental spec-<lb/>tra slightly deviate from the theoretical fits just above <lb/>the coherence peaks -this deviation was not seen in case <lb/>of non intercalated PdTe 2 . As we will discuss later, this <lb/>type of spectra correspond to a higher T c ∼ 2.4 K. At <lb/>certain other points, the spectra are seen to be different <lb/>and their analysis reveal a smaller ∆ ∼ 0.44 meV. These <lb/>spectra also correspond to a lower T c ∼ 1.7 K. The de-<lb/>viation of the experimental data from the theoretical fits <lb/>are seen for these spectra as well. For the spectra with <lb/>smaller ∆, though the T c remains to be same as that of <lb/>pure PdTe 2 , the gap is measured to be higher than in <lb/>pure PdTe 2 (∼ 0.32 meV)[9]. Hence, the the effect of <lb/>intercalation is present everywhere including the points <lb/>where a lower T c (and lower ∆) is measured. <lb/>From a comparative consideration of the results dis-<lb/>cussed above, it appears that the superconducting phase <lb/>with higher T c that is expected to emerge upon Cu-<lb/>intercalation (as per bulk measurements) appears at sev-<lb/>eral places (as in figure 1(c)) while, at several other <lb/>places, the enhancement of superconducting properties is <lb/>less (as in Figure 1(d)). This suggests that the phase with <lb/>higher T c , though does not arise uniformly throughout <lb/>the crystals, exceeds the percolation threshold thereby <lb/>contributing predominantly in bulk transport measure-<lb/>ments. In order to search for a correlation between the <lb/>domains with higher T c phase and the defect states due <lb/>to Cu, we performed local spectroscopy near and away <lb/>from such defects. It was observed that the higher T c <lb/>phase appears more frequently in the Cu rich regions. <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.1 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.3 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>Expt <lb/>BCS <lb/> <lb/>(meV) <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.1 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.3 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>Expt <lb/>BCS <lb/> <lb/>(meV) <lb/>0.5 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2 1.5 1.8 <lb/>T (K) <lb/>T (K) <lb/>-1.5 -1.0 -0.5 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.5 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>1.62 K <lb/>0.39 K <lb/>(dI/dV) <lb/>N <lb/>0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 <lb/>V (mV) <lb/>-1.5 -1.0 -0.5 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>0.9 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.3 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>2.4 K <lb/>0.31 K <lb/>(dI/dV) <lb/>N <lb/>0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 <lb/>V (mV) <lb/>(a) <lb/>(b) <lb/>(c) <lb/>(d) <lb/>FIG. 2. Temperature dependence of conductance spectra (a) <lb/>with higher Tc (b) with lower Tc (c, d) ∆ vs Γ plot extracted <lb/>from (a, b) respectively. <lb/>One of the most intriguing features of the supercon-<lb/>ducting phase of PdTe 2 is that despite hosting topologi-<lb/>cally non-trivial bands crossing the Fermi surface[21, 22], <lb/>the superconducting order parameter is found to be con-<lb/>ventional and is seen to follow BCS-like temperature <lb/>dependence[13, 23]. The conventional nature of the tem-<lb/>perature dependence is also found in case of the two en-<lb/>ergy gaps that are measured in Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 . <lb/>The temperature dependent spectra along with the the-<lb/>oretical fits are shown in Figure 2(a) for the phase with <lb/>higher ∆ and in Figure 2(b) for the phase with lower ∆. <lb/>Surprisingly, in both the cases, while the lowest temper-<lb/>ature spectra showed no additional features other than <lb/>the sharp coherence peaks, at slightly elevated temper-<lb/>atures a small zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP) is <lb/>also seen to appear. When the emergence of the ZBCP <lb/>is considered along with the slight deviation of the ex-<lb/>perimental spectra from the theoretical fit, it is impor-<lb/>tant to first investigate whether a tiny unconventional <lb/>component in the order parameter can be present here. <lb/>Such a ZBCP may appear due to a small unconventional <lb/>component in the gap function that has a different tem-<lb/>perature dependence than the dominating conventional <lb/>component. In order to understand this point clearly, <lb/>let us consider a temperature dependent gap amplitude <lb/>given by ∆(T ) = α∆ s (T ) + β∆ un (T ), where ∆ s is the <lb/>conventional component and ∆ un is the unconventional <lb/>component of the gap, and α and β are the respective <lb/>coefficients. Now, since the ZBCP does not appear at <lb/></body>

		<body>low temperatures, it is clear that at those temperatures, <lb/>α∆ s <lb/>β∆ un . Now, with increasing temperature, due <lb/>to the possible difference in temperature dependence of <lb/>∆ s and ∆ un , at some point, the contribution of ∆ un <lb/>may become comparable to ∆ s thereby making the un-<lb/>conventional contribution detectable in the form of the <lb/>ZBCP. Beyond this temperature, as shown in the data, <lb/>all the spectroscopic features related to superconductiv-<lb/>ity get systematically reduced with a complete disappear-<lb/>ance of the spectral features at T c . It should be noted <lb/>that while the possibility of an unconventional compo-<lb/>nent cannot be ruled out, the ZBCP may also originate <lb/>from other sources, like inelastic impurity scattering with <lb/>non-trivial temperature dependence. Since no ZBCP is <lb/>seen in pure PdTe 2 , here, the enhanced scattering may be <lb/>due to the impurity states of the Cu intercalates. Since <lb/>the strength of the ZBCP is significantly smaller than <lb/>the overall spectra, we have fitted the temperature de-<lb/>pendent spectra ignoring the ZBCP. The temperature <lb/>dependent ∆ thus obtained, are plotted in Figure 2(c) <lb/>and Figure 2(d) respectively for the larger ∆ and the <lb/>smaller ∆. The red dots represent the measured values <lb/>of ∆ and the solid lines show the expected temperature <lb/>dependence within BCS theory, barring a slight devia-<lb/>tion at higher temperatures. In both the cases, the tem-<lb/>perature evolution of the spectra is consistent with BCS <lb/>theory[24]. From the measured valued of ∆ and T c , it is <lb/>seen that ∆/k B T c are ∼ 2.56 and 3.15 corresponding to <lb/>the larger ∆ and the smaller ∆ respectively. This means, <lb/>the regions where the effect of intercalation is smaller, <lb/>∆/k B T c is higher. This shows that the elctron-phonon <lb/>coupling strength decreases upon Cu-intercalation. This <lb/>result apparently contradicts the theoretical finding of <lb/>an enhanced electron-phonon coupling constant (λ ph ) in <lb/>Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 [18]. Therefore, our results sug-<lb/>gest that the enhancement in T c in Cu-PdTe 2 is primarily <lb/>due to the enhanced density of states at the Fermi energy <lb/>and not due to altered electron-phonon coupling. How-<lb/>ever, these two processes may compete with each other <lb/>giving rise to an effective enhancement of superconduct-<lb/>ing properties in Cu-PdTe 2 . <lb/>Now we focus on the magnetic field dependent spec-<lb/>troscopic measurements on Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 . As it <lb/>was discovered before, the surface of pure PdTe 2 hosts <lb/>co-existence of domains with type I and type II super-<lb/>conductivity. In the type I domains, the superconducting <lb/>spectra suddenly disappeared under the application of a <lb/>low magnetic field ∼ 250 Oe. In the type II regions, the <lb/>spectra survived up to much higher magnetic fields and <lb/>the spectral features were seen to disappear continuously. <lb/>Such variation of the type of superconductivity based <lb/>on magnetic properties could be attributed to inhomo-<lb/>geneity of local coherence length (ξ). An inhomogeneous <lb/>background possibly responsible for such inhomogeneity <lb/>in ξ was found in the normal state conductance maps. <lb/>Within this understanding, introduction of disorder into <lb/>the crystal is expected to reduce ξ everywhere. <lb/>In Figure 3(a,b,c) we show magnetic field dependent <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>0.00 <lb/>0.05 <lb/>0.10 <lb/>0.15 <lb/>0.20 <lb/>0.25 <lb/>0.30 <lb/>0.35 <lb/>0.40 <lb/>H(kG) <lb/>(meV) <lb/>0.00 <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.03 <lb/>0.04 <lb/>0.05 <lb/>(meV) <lb/>(a) <lb/>(b) <lb/>(c) <lb/>(d) <lb/>-2 <lb/>-1 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>1.4 <lb/>T = 310 mK <lb/>(0) = 0.335 meV <lb/>H C ~ 17 kG <lb/>(dI/dV) <lb/>N <lb/>V(mV) <lb/>0 kG <lb/>17 kG <lb/>-2 <lb/>-1 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>1.4 <lb/>1.6 <lb/>T = 310 mK <lb/>(0) = 0.5 meV <lb/>H C ~ 10 kG <lb/>(dI/dV) <lb/>N <lb/>V(mV) <lb/>0 kG <lb/>10 kG <lb/>-1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.0 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>1.4 <lb/>1.6 <lb/>T = 310 mK <lb/>(0) = 0.39 meV <lb/>H C ~ 4.5 kG <lb/>Experimental <lb/>Fit <lb/>(dI/dV) <lb/>N <lb/>V(mV) <lb/>4.5 kG <lb/>0 kG <lb/>FIG. 3.

In all <lb/>cases, the conductance spectra, regardless of the corre-<lb/>sponding superconducting energy gaps and T c , evolved <lb/>systematically and smoothly with magnetic field. The <lb/>spectral features continuously became less prominent <lb/>eventually disappearing at a critical field characteristic <lb/>for the point where the spectroscopic measurement was <lb/>performed. The critical fields measured in these cases are <lb/>10 kG, 17 kG and 4.5 kG respectively. The ubiquitously <lb/>observed very low critical field (∼ 220 Oe) in PdTe 2 was <lb/>not detected on any point in Cu-PdTe 2 . It should be <lb/>noted that the measured critical fields at different points <lb/>is much larger than the expected &quot;surface critical field&quot; <lb/>(H s ∼ 1.7H c ) in BCS superconductors[25-27]. Hence <lb/>the enhancement is not due to a naturally enhanced sur-<lb/>face critical field. In Figure 3(c), we also show Dyne&apos;s fit <lb/>of one set of the magnetic field dependent spectra and <lb/>the variation of the superconducting energy gap with in-<lb/>creasing magnetic field is shown in Figure 3(d), where the <lb/>smooth disappearance of the gap is clearly visible. This <lb/>observation indicates that the superconductivity of Cu-<lb/>PdTe 2 has become uniformly of type II throughout the <lb/>crystal upon intercalation of Cu. This is different from <lb/>the mixed type I and type II superconducting phase that <lb/>was observed in pure PdTe 2 [14]. <lb/>The observation of the uniformly type II behaviour of <lb/>the superconducting phase upon Cu-intercalation sup-<lb/>ports the idea that the mixed type I and type II phase <lb/>in pure PdTe 2 originated from a distribution of the local <lb/>coherence length (ξ) and consequent distribution of κ. <lb/>Introduction of disorder in the lattice causes increased <lb/>scattering and a consequent decrease in the electronic <lb/></body>

		<body>mean free path (l) leading to a decreased ξ following the <lb/>relation 1/ξ = 1/ξ 0 + 1/l, where ξ 0 is the BCS coher-<lb/>ence length in the absolute clean limit. When the local <lb/>ξ in the type I regions decrease, the GLAG parameter <lb/>(κ) also decreases and consequently these regions should <lb/>show magnetic properties of that of type II supercon-<lb/>ductors. The criteria for the transition from a type I <lb/>to a type II superconducting state in terms of the mean <lb/>free path (l) has been discussed elsewhere where it was <lb/>also shown that beyond a critical value of l, the super-<lb/>conducting phase is expected to become homogeneously <lb/>type II[14]. <lb/>Another aspect of the magnetic field dependence of ∆ <lb/>that needs attention is a sudden change in ∆ at H ∼ <lb/>100 Oe, where ∆ decreases to almost 50 % of the zero <lb/>field value. In a type II superconductor, such a sudden <lb/>change may be associated with the emergence of a su-<lb/>perconducting vortex in an area very close to the STM <lb/>tip thereby causing the suppression of local ∆. As shown <lb/>in the Γ vs. H plot in Figure 3(d), as ∆ shows a sud-<lb/>den drop, Γ shows a simultaneous upward jump (by a <lb/>factor of 6) at approximately the same magnetic field. <lb/>Γ represents pair breaking mechanisms leading to finite <lb/>quasiparticle lifetime. Hence, this observation is consis-<lb/>tent with the field-induced pair breaking under the STM <lb/>tip, possibly due to the emergence of a nearby vortex <lb/>core. However, despite our repeated attempts, we did <lb/>not find spectra with clear zero-bias conductance peak <lb/>in presence of magnetic field. To note, such zero-bias <lb/>peaks in presence of sufficiently large magnetic field were <lb/>frequently observed in pure PdTe 2 . It is possible that in <lb/>case of Cu-PdTe 2 , the nature of the vortex core spectrum <lb/>changes and becomes featureless and hence remains un-<lb/>detectable in our experiments. Beyond the field at which <lb/>the sudden change happens, both ∆ and Γ change grad-<lb/>ually and beyond a certain field Γ becomes larger than <lb/>∆ thereby suppressing the key spectroscopic features. <lb/>In conclusion, we have performed detailed scan-<lb/>ning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy on Cu-<lb/>intercalated crystals of PdTe 2 at different temperatures <lb/>and magnetic fields. The motivation was to address the <lb/>fate of the intriguing magnetic properties of PdTe 2 upon <lb/>Cu-intercalation. We found that Cu-intercalation en-<lb/>hances the critical temperature throughout the crystal <lb/>surface. In addition to T c enhancement, due to increased <lb/>disorder, the surface of Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 becomes <lb/>uniformly type II with no signature of co-existing type I <lb/>phase anywhere. The effective critical field at all points <lb/>becomes higher than that in the type I phase of pure <lb/>PdTe 2 . The results support the idea that the magnetic <lb/>properties and electronic structure in PdTe 2 surface are <lb/>highly correlated and the peculiar magnetic properties <lb/>reported before are a consequence of such correlation. <lb/>AV thanks UGC for senior research fellowship (SRF). <lb/></body>
